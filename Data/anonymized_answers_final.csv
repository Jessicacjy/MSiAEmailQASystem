RE: Curious Student^Hello Darren:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe currently have only had two classes come through our program, we are a relatively new Masters Program here at NU. Our first cohort had 32 students accepted but only 30 students enrolled. Our second cohort was the full 32 students. We will only accept 32 this year as well. In terms of project work and in keeping with our goal to provide a cohort system we are unlikely to be expanding the numbers much in the future. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question, please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: question about application^Hello Stephanie:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question when we are evaluating a transcript we look for candidates to have a background in statistics. It is beneficial to have both calculus and linear algebra on the transcript as well, but not necessarily required. Our current student profile has the majority of accepted students coming from an Engineering background (38%), so I would agree that the engineering background is well suited for this program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

He graduated chemical engineering from Seoul National University.\r\n\r\nIn terms of applying to master program in department of analytics, is it required to have taken classes of linear algebra or advanced mathematics other than calculus? He has taken calculus and mathematics for engineers but not other than that. He is open to take summer course before the class starts, if he can get admission, but we are not sure if the courses are crucial to get admission or not. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would be very helpful for us to know if having engineering background makes us suitable for this program or not. We think it is and he really wants to study this field, but we hope to know your opinion before we begin application process. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help in advance. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nStephanie \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStephanie Kwon\r\nSnurr  & Stair Research Group\r\nDept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering\r\nNorthwestern University\r\nEvanston, IL 60208, USA\r\nTel) 847-467-3252 \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=OMA36151E^EX^Stephanie Young Sun Kwon^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Syk638^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^9db78e5de5546d287f46010a7980a761^1f58fb9e90fdd9cfb81f7e273aab70d7,,,,,,
RE: graduate school application^Dear Chen:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we do not require a TOEFL from you if your degree was issued by Purdue University. As long as the degree granting institution uses English as the primary language your fluency requirement is satisfied. We do not require Financial evidence upon applying. If you believe the courses at a community college will help bolster your application, I encourage you to submit those transcripts. Some students will supplement their undergraduate degree with quantitative classes or computer science classes and then include them in the application. \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Admission Questions^Dear Fan: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo answer your questions:\r\n\r\n1.       We do not have any strict prerequisite courses, but we look for you to have taken calculus and statistics courses. We are more focused on the quantitative background when we are evaluating transcripts. In terms of computer science backgrounds, we provide a 2 week boot camp training session before our academic calendar begins. This boot camp brings in industry trainers from SQL, Cognos, SPSS, SAS, and Tableau to train our students. Some accepted students will enter the program with a background in Java and Python but it is not a requirement for applying. \r\n\r\n2.       I encourage you to supply your UNM transcript. You can list it as a separate education experience in the online application. When you do so, it will allow me to upload your transcript under the correct heading, as opposed to uploading it as other\r\n\r\n3.       Your decision to take online courses in Coursera should be included in your resume or CV. Many accepted students went that route to strengthen their application. Any certification of your knowledge will help make you stand out against other applicants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Prospective Applicant^Hello Bella:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe accept 32 students a year. While this will undoubtedly mean that admission will be highly selective, it will also mean we can give appropriate attention to those who are admitted. We are aiming to foster a collaborative atmosphere within the program and believe that a small cohort of exceptionally talented and strongly motivated students will best enable us to achieve this. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile we have many students enrolled in our program form CS and EE backgrounds we do not limit our admissions process to those academic majors. We look to build a collaborative cohort each year with a variety of backgrounds and interests. We have not had students in our program with a similar background to yours and I would be sure to mention that in your personal statement. As an academic institution we are very interested in applying analytics in a wide variety of fields of interest. I would not look at your background as weaker or negative, but unique. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what other questions and concerns you have about applying to our program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Question from South Korea^Hello Jay:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions please see below:\r\n\r\n1.       To answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions. \r\n\r\n2.       Both GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the  <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html> registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJay Lim\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSent from Windows Mail\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Reg : Master of Science in Analytics^Dear Alok;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions, the MSiA program is full-time for 15 months (including a required summer industry-focused internship). There are no online courses or part-time options available for this particular intensive program. Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working. You can find more information on that program here: http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/ <http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 2014. I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2015!\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MSiA Application Transcripts^Dear Rahul;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in my response time, we have been a little behind with emails due to applications. We will be updating the website shortly with placement statistics, however, we had 100% of our students receive job offers before they graduated from our program. Unfortunately, we have not heard back from all of our students and therefore our compensation median is not entirely reflective of everyone in the program. We have a current median at $85,000.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCheck our website in the next couple of weeks, we will be making updates to the website with our final numbers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have additional questions,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCurrently, we are unable to accept students into a spring quarter.

RE: Admission Enquiry for Masters of Science in Analytics^Dear Aditi:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question we primarily will evaluate candidates based on their quantitative background. I see you have Statistics and Calculus on your transcripts. Those are some of the key classes we look at to evaluate our applicants with. We do not expect you to have experience in programing. We provide a two-week boot camp where we have industry partners from SAS, SQL, tableau, etc. come to campus for full-day instruction and informational sessions. You are not required to have a mastery of these programs prior to entering the MSiA program. We also include classes such as java as a foundation course in the first quarter. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Inquiries of Admission-MS in Analytics-Jianhao Long^Hello Steven:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI just want to make sure I understand you question correctly. What specifically are you referring to in your question? Is this for a loan for financial support? We do not require such evidence in our decision to give admittance to a candidate. However, after acceptance if you wish to take out a loan then you will be required to provide such evidence. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know how I can further answer your question.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: question about application^Dear Shannon;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. Test scores must be less than two years old at the date of matriculation (for the 2014-15 cohort, this will be September 23, 2014). The minimum acceptable score for the TOEFL is 85 (Internet based test) and for the IELTS, 7.0. Our TOEFL code is 3144. In regards to your work experience, we have students who come from 1year to 18years of work experience in our program (I have included a class breakdown in this email).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Prospective Applicant^Hello Bella:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe accept 32 students a year. While this will undoubtedly mean that admission will be highly selective, it will also mean we can give appropriate attention to those who are admitted. We are aiming to foster a collaborative atmosphere within the program and believe that a small cohort of exceptionally talented and strongly motivated students will best enable us to achieve this. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile we have many students enrolled in our program form CS and EE backgrounds we do not limit our admissions process to those academic majors. We look to build a collaborative cohort each year with a variety of backgrounds and interests. We have not had students in our program with a similar background to yours and I would be sure to mention that in your personal statement. As an academic institution we are very interested in applying analytics in a wide variety of fields of interest. I would not look at your background as weaker or negative, but unique. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what other questions and concerns you have about applying to our program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

Our students do have backgrounds in calculus, statistics, and programming. Some of our students took courses offered by COURSERA (or similar programs) to supplement these courses on their transcripts. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MSiA questions^Dear Deependra;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we understand that some of our students will find courses redundant to their current knowledge of the Analytics industry. We allow students to take courses to supplement their redundant classes with the approval of our Program Director. After proof of your current knowledge of the subject we will work with you to find a course offered by Northwestern which interests you. \r\n\r\nWe are a designated STEM program, for more information I encourage you to explore our International Office website at http://www.northwestern.edu/international/student/stem-opt.html\r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: Regarding Admission in M.S(Analytics)^Dear Prakhar:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question about our scholarship options; we offer a limited number of fellowships to applicants. These fellowships will pay for fifty percent (50%) of tuition costs for the 4 quarters you are taking classes on campus. We determine who receives those fellowships solely on merit. Your application to our program is the means that we evaluate candidates for fellowships. There are additional funding opportunities at Northwestern University, but we do not have any input or control over those scholarships. I have linked our page on Tuition and Fees <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html>  from our website, which provides more contacts for tuition funding here at Northwestern.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). Many applicants will provide their GRE scores as proof of their quantitative background, I would recommend you submit your scores if you believe it will strengthen your application. The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics-NWU^Dear Rohit;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we are currently unable to accept students during our Spring term on campus (March-June). We only accept students annually to begin in the Fall (Sept). Due to our industry projects we are restricted to only accept our 32 students in one cohort. We require students to complete at 9month practicum project, a 10week internship, followed by a 3month capstone project. Due to the level of group work, we are unable to accept students outside of our first intake. \r\n\r\nWe would be happy to enroll you in our 2015-2016 cohort, however, which is a 15month fulltime program. For more information in regards to financial aid and funding, I encourage you to explore those possibilities on our website, linked  <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> here.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 2014. I hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MSiA questions^Dear Deependra;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we understand that some of our students will find courses redundant to their current knowledge of the Analytics industry. We allow students to take courses to supplement their redundant classes with the approval of our Program Director. After proof of your current knowledge of the subject we will work with you to find a course offered by Northwestern which interests you. \r\n\r\nWe are a designated STEM program, for more information I encourage you to explore our International Office website at http://www.northwestern.edu/international/student/stem-opt.html\r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MSiA Program^Dear Matthew:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.  The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to below for answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.       Typically we do not release this information about our students. We require a minimum GPA of 3.0. Since we do not require a GRE we do not provide average scores, and we require a minimum of 85 in our TOEFL scores, to gauge the caliber of students admitted into our program I encourage you to look at our Current students page which provides an effective class profile.\r\n\r\n2.       Due to the project based nature of our program we require our students to graduate within the 15months they are enrolled in our program. We are a cohort based system. You will be a part of a 9month industry practicum project, which solves real world issues with business. Then you enter a required 10 week internship, where you will apply your knowledge of analytics in an internship setting. Your final project is a capstone project which is a 3month industry supplied project where you demonstrate what you have learnt at Northwestern University. Each of these projects are team based and are required to be completed by deadline. \r\n\r\n3.       Each year we aim to enroll 32 students to our cohort. \r\n\r\n4.       I encourage you to provide recommendations from whomever gives us the best sense of your analytics background. The guidelines on the website are a suggestion, but we would like to have a rounded understanding of what your analytics background is and what exposure/experience you have had in analytics.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: Question about TOEFL^Dear Zhihao;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate.

RE: About Official Transcript^Dear Yifan:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we accept scanned copies of your transcript. You do not need to send us an official transcript from your University. You can send us the PDF to this email address. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Question on Recommendations^Dear Matt;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I apologize in the delay of this response, I have been out of the office. If you require any continuing assistance please let us know. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the three academic references are only a suggestion. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe application system will email your recommenders at the email address you provide. Recommenders will receive a request to address the questions outlined above as well as instructions on how to upload their completed letter into the application system. Recommenders may use standard word processing software for letters. For more information I encourage you to look at our website under Prospective Students. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: Curious Student^Hello Darren:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe currently have only had two classes come through our program, we are a relatively new Masters Program here at NU. Our first cohort had 32 students accepted but only 30 students enrolled. Our second cohort was the full 32 students. We will only accept 32 this year as well. In terms of project work and in keeping with our goal to provide a cohort system we are unlikely to be expanding the numbers much in the future. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question, please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Application Questions^Hello Alice:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf that is the way your University prefers to handle transcripts we entirely understand. If you could mail us the transcript in an envelope (such as FedEx or DHL) sealed then that is acceptable to our program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHowever, for your application you only need to submit scanned transcripts from your university. You do not need to submit the original documents unless youre admitted to the program. If it is easier for you to email me a scanned copy do not feel pressured to mail us the originals. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question, please let me know if I can be of further assistance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Application Questions^Dear Alice;\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your two questions:\r\n1. With regards to your TOEFL score, you will not need to submit a TOEFL score as long as the degree granting institution (Univ. of Michigan) is an English speaking institution. \r\n2. Unfortunately, we currently do not offer a PhD in Analytics. We only provide the MS degree. If you are looking to go into academia with analytics, the IEMS department here at Northwestern offers an Analytics focus. That may be a better fit for you if you are looking to get a PhD.

RE: MS in Business Analytics : Fall 2014^Dear S Nayak:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n1.       We are a masters program housed under the Industrial Engineering and Management Studies department. Because we are we do qualify as a STEM program. \r\n\r\n2.       Tuition Fees <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> : For the 2013-2014 it will be $15,038/qtr. Your tuition will be due for the fall, winter, and spring quarters but not in the summer. \r\n\r\n3.       We offer a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional application will need to be submitted for consideration. Please visit the Tuition and Fees page on our website for more opportunities of financial support within the Northwestern School system. We only control the Fellowships offered by our program. \r\n\r\n4.       We encourage you to submit a GRE score if you believe it will help prove your quantitative knowledge to our admissions committee. If you feel your academic transcript does not show your quantitative background then I would suggest submitting the GRE. 75% of our accepted students had submitted their scores. This is not a requirement for consideration for our program, nor for our Fellowship.\r\n\r\n5.       Estimated Cost of Living: We tell students to budget around $22,000 for living expenses. There is a full breakdown of our costs on the Tuition page of our website. \r\n\r\n6.       In terms of Financial documents, we do not require those. That is outside of our office, if you have questions I would suggest reaching out to the International Office to discuss obtaining an I20\r\n\r\n7.       Currently we are graduating our inaugural cohort. We do not yet have any job placement statistics to provide. Once our students have graduated we will be updating our website with that information. Please check back with us at the end of December. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Questions for applying master in analytics program^Dear Wangyang:\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n1.  To answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions.\r\n2.  Both GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. We do not have a code currently for the GRE. We ask for you to submit a scanned copy to this email address which we keep for our records. Since it is not a requirement  and there is no formal cutoff score for the GRE we do not release or track student information. Only submit your GRE score if you believe it will fill a hole in your transcript and prove your quantitative prowess. \r\n\r\n The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Questions about my application^Hello Mike.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for not responding to your inquiry in a more timely fashion. Unfortunately, due to the high number of emails we have received over the last few days we have been focused on uploading any additional files and compiling applicant packets. I am now seeing your question concerning GMAT scores and I notice we have not received your GMAT score from GMAC. I have gone through our files since the beginning of the academic year and somehow yours was not reported to our program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWould you be able to download your unofficial GMAT score from the GMAC website and email that to me at your earliest convenience. I am in the process of making your applicant packet for the admissions committee. Your material will not be marked as late and I will be sure to attach it to your file once I receive your score. I apologize for any confusion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn regards to your second question, we have received all three of your letters of reference.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope you have a wonderful weekend and I apologize for bothering on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Masters Program at Northwestern University (Fall '14)^Dear Nandini:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. I would be happy to answer your questions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am very sorry to say that because of the high volume of application weve received this admissions season, we are unable to accommodate on-campus visits between now and our admissions decisions. Should you still want to plan a visit to campus and an opportunity to sit in on several classes after March 17, we would be happy to assist.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, I would be happy to schedule a 10 -15 minute call with you and the associate director to answer any questions that you might have about the program. Please let me know if this would be helpful. In regards to an information session, we will not be hosting another one during this application season. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Northwestern University Master of Science in Analytics Program^Dear Tejaswini;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us at the MS in Analytics program at Northwestern University. In regards to your TOEFL score, my recommendation is to provide us with an ecopy the moment your TOEFL score has been issued. We can upload your ecopy until the official scores comes to our office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am confused by your second question, we do not provide teaching or research assistant positions in our program. The Master of Science in Analytics offers a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent (50%) of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional applications will need to be submitted for consideration. For more information in regards to financial aid and funding, I encourage you to explore those possibilities on our website, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know any additional questions your have before our admissions deadline on Feb 15th.\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Interest in MSiA^Dear Marisa:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to me with your questions concerning the Master of Science in Analytics program here at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning our GPA minimum, the 3.0 is a hard minimum. We use it as our first benchmark when we are shortlisting candidates. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen you are comparing our program with the MS in Predictive Analytics outside of the full-time/part-time factor, the other big difference is our industry projects. Here in the MSiA program since we are full time, we expect our students to carry a full class load paired with a 9-month practicum project. The practicum project is an industry supplied project which students use to work with real-world data to solve problems and analyze for companies. Class work is similar but the project and networking included in our program sets us up to fulfill a business need along with the analytics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions concerning NU and our application process.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Difficulty in completing recommendation Letter- NWU^Dear Hassan;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have noticed in your email your recommender has faxed their letter to (847) 491-8539. This is the general fax for McCormick School of Engineering and it is actually a black hole fax number for general McCormick. As listed in my signature, our fax is (847) 491-8005, in regards to this your recommender must list Attn: MS in Analytics for it to come to our program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe other option is for your recommender to email our program directly with their recommendation and I can upload your letter of reference from there.

RE: MSiA Transcript and GMAT scores^Hello Mariela,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delayed response time from our department. I have just gone into our application managing system and I see that your application is completed but was never submitted. We received just under 600 applications this year and we have over 800 opened applications. Due to the turnaround of our admission decisions we did not look at any applications that were not submitted. We are aware of the clunky and archaic application system, and we are planning to use a different application system which is more user friendly. It appears as though you have completed your application and had not selected the Submit function which would take your application from N/A to and Active application. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat being said,  we have sent out our decisions and are close to hearing back from all of our admitted students, and we have a full waitlist and will not be able to offer you a place in our 2014 class. I apologize for both the delay in our response back to you and the inconvenience. I can pass you application file to our admissions committee prior to waitlist discussion and they can determine your admissions status at this point. We will look to have an answer for you soon. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Northwestern Analytics: Application Deadline Reminder ^Dear Jaideep,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics deadline inquiry^Hello John:\r\n\r\nI apologize for my delayed response time. We do look for our students to have some background in computer science. It seems as though you have knowledge of CS and I would be sure to mention it either on your resume or in your personal statement. The other way to have CS appear on your transcript is by taking classes such as CORESERA and including certificates from their programs in your resume. I believe you have an understanding of CS and that will help you application. We also run a 2 week boot camp at the university, where our students are trained how to use SAS, SQL, SPSS, Cognos, Tableau etc. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what other questions you may have about our admissions process.\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Application^Dear Lan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). Since they are not required we do not give out minimums or averages.  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Full time and Part time programs^Dear Rob;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your questions, the MSiA program is full-time for 15 months (including a required summer industry-focused internship). There are no online courses or part-time options available for this particular intensive program. Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working. You can find more information on that program here: http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/ <http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: a question on online course certificate^Dear Jacob\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo address your specific question, I would encourage you to obtain certificates and diversify your education by including courses as you suggested via coursera.

RE: Request for Information - M.S. in Data Science^Dear Naman;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in my response time to your inquiry. To answer your question, we are unable to accept students at any time outside of a fall start. Due to the nature of our program our students work as a cohort.

RE: GRE score report not reflecting in Checklist^Dear Namratha;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question about transcripts, please email us a scanned copy. I will upload this in at least 3-10 business days and it will be reflected in your application checklist. Our admissions review committee only requires a scanned version of your transcript. However, if you are accepted into our program we will require you to send us an official transcript for matriculation. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn regards to your GRE score; as of January 24th we did not have an official code with the GRE. If you submitted your GRE score to Northwestern University it would be given to the central university admissions and we will not receive it in our office, there is nothing to distinguish which program you are applying to using Northwesterns code. We have just opened a code with the GRE (I apologize for the delay) and it is 3672. If you would like to have the GRE send us a report please use this code to reference our specific program at Northwestern University. However, this year due to the delay in the code, we will accept a scanned pdf of your GRE to upload into our system. If you would like to include that in an email I will update your account. Emailing us a scanned version, may be the quickest way to see your scores updated in the MAP system. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Request for Information on the Master of Science in Analytics program^Dear Shalini\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMaster of Science in Analytics tuition for the 2013-2014 academic year will be $15,038 per quarter. Tuition is due for the fall, winter and spring quarters but not the summer.  \r\n\r\nAdditional expenses should be considered:\r\n\r\n          On campus annual cost of living expenses of $22,0,\r\n\r\n          Approximately $500-$1,000 for textbooks,\r\n\r\n          $3,067 for Northwestern University health insurance,\r\n\r\n          $5,000 miscellaneous (personal, transportation, etc). \r\n\r\nThe total cost of the Master of Science in Analytics degree will be about $85,000 to $90,000 depending on the student's needs. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions concerning financial aid The Master of Science in Analytics offers a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent (50%) of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional applications will need to be submitted for consideration. In addition to the fellowships offered directly through the program, Master of Science in Analytics students may be eligible for other types of support. Resources may be found at the McCormick School of Engineering  <http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/graduates/current_student_resources/fellowships_internships/index.html> Fellowships and Internships page or at Northwestern University's  <http://www.northwestern.edu/fellowships/> Office of Fellowships\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Northwestern University: Master of Science in Analytics Program - Applications are now being accepted for the 2014-2015 cohort^Dear  Saurabh:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo address your question about the fee structure and scholarships offered, the 2013-2014 tuition was $15,038 per quarter you are on campus. You will be expected to study on campus for 3 quarters your first year, then one quarter is an internship (no tuition fee associated with it, and can be paid), then you finish your last quarter on campus. I encourage you to explore our Tuition and Fees webpage on our website for more information, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> . Similarly, you will find information about the fellowships we offer. We provide a limited number of highly qualified candidates a fellowship which will cover 50% of your tuition costs. These fellowships are entirely merit based. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the  <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html> registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

[INSERT SPECIFIC QUESTION ANSWERS HERE] The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions, the MSiA program is full-time for 15 months (including a required summer industry-focused internship).

RE: from an interested applicant^Dear Jeffery\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question; we do not accept students on a rolling admissions. We will not begin reviewing applications until after February 15th. No matter when you submit your application (as long as all of your materials arrive before the deadline) you will be given an equal advantage of all our applicants. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: MS - Analytics^Dear Abdul;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding tuition fees, we do not have a separate tuition fee for international students. The Tuition Fees and Scholarships page applies to all of our students. I have linked that page on our website here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> . Our tuition numbers from this past quarter is $15,038. Our students expect to pay around $85,000-$90,000 total in our program. We offer a limited number of scholarships each year which will pay 50% of the tuition each quarter. These fellowships are entirely merit based. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: Master of Science in Analytics questions^Hello Manjola,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize it has taken so long for our department to respond to your request. We are very eager for you to see our campus and our program. Your request was unique, in that we do not usually allow students to sit in on classes. I know you are eager to come in this week but due to the current academic calendar it would not be the best time. Students are in midterms and they will be testing all week. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe want to offer you one of the following two options:\r\n\r\n1.       In January we have a guest speaker coming for a seminar lecture, we would love to have you come and visit, sit in on our seminar series and a class, as well as a meeting with our associate director. \r\n\r\n2.       If you want to visit in the fall, you can take a campus tour and have a 15min meeting with our Associate Director. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know which option works best for your calendar. Again I apologize for the tardiness in response from our office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

We have students coming straight from their undergraduate degree and others who have up to 10 years' experience in industry.  \r\n\r\n The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics questions^Hello Manjola,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize it has taken so long for our department to respond to your request. We are very eager for you to see our campus and our program. Your request was unique, in that we do not usually allow students to sit in on classes. I know you are eager to come in this week but due to the current academic calendar it would not be the best time. Students are in midterms and they will be testing all week. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe want to offer you one of the following two options:\r\n\r\n1.       In January we have a guest speaker coming for a seminar lecture, we would love to have you come and visit, sit in on our seminar series and a class, as well as a meeting with our associate director. \r\n\r\n2.       If you want to visit in the fall, you can take a campus tour and have a 15min meeting with our Associate Director. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know which option works best for your calendar. Again I apologize for the tardiness in response from our office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

Students begin working on that in teams of 4 from day 1 of class.

We will begin in September and then graduate the following December 2015.

RE: Reg : Master of Science in Analytics^Dear Alok;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions, the MSiA program is full-time for 15 months (including a required summer industry-focused internship). There are no online courses or part-time options available for this particular intensive program. Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working. You can find more information on that program here:  <http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/> http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: Admissions questions ^Dear Serena;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.  The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, The Master of Science in Analytics will admit only 32 of students each fall quarter. While this will undoubtedly mean that admission will be highly selective, it will also mean we can give appropriate attention to those who are admitted. We are aiming to foster a collaborative atmosphere within the program and believe that a small cohort of exceptionally talented and strongly motivated students will best enable us to achieve this. We have received an increase in applications each year since the inception of our program. We have an acceptance rate a little below 10%. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: Registration Confirmation ^Dear Siddharth;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we have received your application fee. We use a third party to collect our application fees and there is a delay between the two systems. We do not update the student checklists until the Monday of each week. I have manually adjusted your account to show that you have paid. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to your GRE score, we have not received it at our office as of today, 2/11. Typically, when ETS sends out scores they bundle them in one large packet. Due to the recent bad weather here in the United States we have had a delay in our mail delivery. My advice is for you to email us a PDF from the ETS website which acknowledges your scores (if the best you can find is a screen shot) I will attach this to your file until your original score arrives. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics deadline inquiry^Hello John:\r\n\r\nI apologize for my delayed response time. We do look for our students to have some background in computer science. It seems as though you have knowledge of CS and I would be sure to mention it either on your resume or in your personal statement. The other way to have CS appear on your transcript is by taking classes such as CORESERA and including certificates from their programs in your resume. I believe you have an understanding of CS and that will help you application. We also run a 2 week boot camp at the university, where our students are trained how to use SAS, SQL, SPSS, Cognos, Tableau etc. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what other questions you may have about our admissions process.\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Info on Masterns in Analytics^Dear Sayan;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see the following for answers to your questions;\r\n\r\n1.       Financial Aid Information: We provide a limited number of fellowships to students. This fellowship will cover 50% of tuition costs during the 4 quarters of classes. We select the top students to provide this fellowship, there is not additional application for the fellowship. If you are looking for more information in regards to financial aid our website has links to various options outside of our program for scholarships, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n2.       Accommodations: Many of our students chose to rent apartments in Evanston or in Chicago. However, the university does offer graduate student housing. We leave student accommodations entirely up to the applicants. \r\n\r\n3.       We ask for a minimum of 7.0 for IELTS reports. Your 8.5 score is above our minimum. We accept scanned copies of your IELTS score.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the  <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html> registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: admissions^Dear Sumeet;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question concerning the GRE; neither the GRE nor the GMAT are required for admission to the Master of Science in Analytics but we will accept scores from applicants who choose to provide them to us. We believe we can draw enough information from the remainder of an application package to make an assessment of a candidate's suitability for the program. In some cases, supplying a standardized test score may be recommended, particularly in instances where a high score might be indicative of abilities not demonstrated elsewhere in the application. During admissions for the 2013-14 cohort, approximately 75% of candidates provided scores. Unfortunately, we cannot accept any additional materials after Feb 15th. We have a very small window of time for our reviewers to evaluate applicants before they are provided offer letters, therefore we will be creating student applicant packets for completed applications directly after the 15th. Your application is complete without you sitting for the GMAT. \r\n\r\nIn regards to your question concerning your transcripts from India, we do not require official transcripts until after you have been admitted to the program. Our admissions committee can evaluate scanned pdf copies of your transcript. Due to the approaching deadline, I would recommend you to email us at  xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Sumeet Aneja xxx@xxx.xxx You must submit official, sealed transcripts mailed directly from the University to the MAP office\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks, Sumeet\r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=OMA36151E^EX^Sumeet xxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Information on employment^Dear Piyush;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we have just graduated our first cohort and have not yet released our industry statistics. We are awaiting some information from students before we publish on our site. However, I can tell you that before our students graduated 93% already accepted jobs, and after graduation 100% have received job offers. In regards to names of companies who have hired from MSiA, we have a list of companies on our website, page linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/index.html> , who offered our students internships over the summer. 90% of these internships produced job offers to the students who were at the respective companies. A few students declined those positions, but that can provide you with an idea of which companies have recruited with us in the past year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Northwestern Analytics: Application Deadline Reminder ^Dear Jaideep,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MSiA Program Questions^Dear Joanna;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question in regards to management classes, there is some flexibility in the courses students take, but we are not focused on Management in our course, if this is something you are interested in I encourage you to look at our Master of Engineering Management,  <http://mem.northwestern.edu/> linked here.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: MSiA Prospective student question^Dear Shiva;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I would love to answer your questions, I apologize for the delay in our response time. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions; \r\n\r\n1.       With regards to anything related to visas we suggest students to research the Northwestern University Internationals Offices website. They have an entire staff focused on all of the laws and rules associated with visas. We prefer not to provide any advice or information in this regard in case we do not give you correct information. Their website is linked here.\r\n\r\n2.       Each student will complete 3 industry provided projects while they attend our program. Our Practicum project and Capstone project are not paid projects for the students. These are used to learn and develop your skills to make you successful in the workplace. They are paired with your classes and you will learn and develop skills to accompany these projects. However, you are able to negotiate your payment for the internship in the summer quarter. We allow students to choose any internship they would like in any industry (as long as it fulfills an analytics requirement) and they negotiate their summer salary.\r\n\r\n3.       In regards to selection of projects, our director selects 8 companies and company supplied projects for the practicum assignment. Students then apply to us with the projects they would like to work on and we then assign students to one of the projects. Projects cross all industry and fields. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program.

RE: Require details of the course^Dear Raj;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for our delayed response time to your inquiry regarding GPA conversion in this program.

RE: GRE score report not reflecting in Checklist^Dear Namratha;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question about transcripts, please email us a scanned copy. I will upload this in at least 3-10 business days and it will be reflected in your application checklist. Our admissions review committee only requires a scanned version of your transcript. However, if you are accepted into our program we will require you to send us an official transcript for matriculation. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn regards to your GRE score; as of January 24th we did not have an official code with the GRE. If you submitted your GRE score to Northwestern University it would be given to the central university admissions and we will not receive it in our office, there is nothing to distinguish which program you are applying to using Northwesterns code. We have just opened a code with the GRE (I apologize for the delay) and it is 3672. If you would like to have the GRE send us a report please use this code to reference our specific program at Northwestern University. However, this year due to the delay in the code, we will accept a scanned pdf of your GRE to upload into our system. If you would like to include that in an email I will update your account. Emailing us a scanned version, may be the quickest way to see your scores updated in the MAP system. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Northwestern University: Master of Science in Analytics Program - Applications are now being accepted for the 2014-2015 cohort^Dear Santosh;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I have included the directions from our website in regards to submitting your additional application materials, if you would like more detail I encourage you to look at our prospective students page, linked  <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/materials.html> here. \r\n\r\nGRE and GMAT (not compulsory, submission details below)\r\n\r\nNeither the GRE nor the GMAT are required for admission to the Master of Science in Analytics but we will accept scores from applicants who choose to provide them to us. We believe we can draw enough information from the remainder of an application package to make an assessment of a candidate's suitability for the program. In some cases, supplying a standardized test score may be recommended, particularly in instances where a high score might be indicative of abilities not demonstrated elsewhere in the application. During admissions for the 2013-14 cohort, approximately 75% of candidates provided scores. \r\n\r\nInstitution codes for the GRE and GMAT will be forthcoming. Until posted otherwise, please email scanned copies of the report to  xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nOn Fri, Dec 6, 2013 at 1:16 AM, Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx > wrote:\r\n\r\nanalytics@ xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n                                       Find me , Hear Me xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RE: Question about program application^Dear Roy;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.  To answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is left to your discretion who writes your letters of reference. We will accept mailed letters as long as they reach our office by the deadline of February 15th. It would be quickest for your recommender to email us an electronic version, however, we do understand there is a preference for a mailed letter of reference. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MSiA 2014^Dear Anurag;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, please see the following:\r\n\r\n1.       We have suggested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n2.       Tuition is $15,038 per quarter, you will be in classes for 4 academic quarters. However,  during the summer you will not have to pay tuition and you can take a paid internship to offset the cost. For more information on our tuition and fees I encourage you to investigate our page on the website, linked  <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> here.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: Enquiry^Dear Jayarj;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, please see the following:\r\n\r\n1.       We have just graduated our first cohort this winter. We will be releasing salary information and job placement shortly. I apologize for the inability to address your question.\r\n\r\n2.       We use both the University Career Services, and our own contacts to help our students find internships for the summer. We work one on one with our students to ensure they have an internship in the field they are interested in. Since, internships are a required aspect in our course we make sure all of our students have a summer internship. You can find all of the internships our first class had on our current students page, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/index.html> .\r\n\r\n3.

RE: Application Questions^Dear Yi:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the cost of $15,000 per quarter are for the four quarters you are taking classes at Northwestern, therefore it does not include the period when you are in your summer internship. Our students typically find summer internships which are paid and therefore have a source of income to offset the tuition cost during the summer. We provide a great deal of help to our students when it comes to the internship. Many students enter the program with an idea of what field of analytics they would like to go into, and therefore we set up opportunities for them to interview. We also send out a resume book which allows companies to view our students and contact them. But you are required to have an internship in our program.\r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: MS admission^Dear Yunyan (Jackie);\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding TOEFL requirements, your undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan will serve as a TOEFL waiver. I will mark this email correspondence in your file. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Master of Sc. in Analytics^Dear Yoong:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n1. We began our program in 2012, and on Thursday, December 12th we graduated our first cohort. \r\n\r\n2. We accept 32 students each year into our program, we do not anticipate expanding the number of students accepted in the near future. \r\n\r\n3. We are entirely separate from the School of Continuing Studies. We do not share faculty or courses. The SCSs MS in Predictive Analytics is a part time program which allows students to take classes online and finish their degree on their schedule. Our program is a full time Professional Masters program which requires you to take our classes (with some flexibility) and finish within 15months. The hallmark feature of our program is our industry collaboration. We require our students to complete 3 industry sponsored projects which they will take alongside their class work. \r\n\r\n4. In regards to your resume, I have included a student profile breakdown below. Our students have a wide variety of academic backgrounds. You exposure to computer science in industry will translate in your resume and provide you with the necessary IT background for this program. \r\n\r\n5. We will not be able to accept your GRE score. We close our applications on February 15th and evaluate our applicants and provide our decisions on March 18th. It is not a requirement and your application will be reviewed by our committee. \r\n\r\n6. We provide a merit based fellowship, which will cover 50% of your tuition fee. There is no additional material required to apply for the fellowship. We use your general program application as an application for our fellowship. I encourage you to research more funding opportunities on our website,  <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> linked here. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

We look for applicants to have a quantitative background, we do not expect them to have the extensive programing background you have but do look for an understanding of stats and calculus.

Unfortunately, we are unable to provide you with the information about our job placement after graduating from our program. Currently, our inaugural cohort is completing their final quarter here. They will be graduating in December, and we will be updating our website with their final placements at that time.

I see you have Statistics and Calculus on your transcripts. Those are some of the key classes we look at to evaluate our applicants with. We do not expect you to have experience in programing. We provide a two-week boot camp where we have industry partners from SAS, SQL, tableau, etc. come to campus for full-day instruction and informational sessions. You are not required to have a mastery of these programs prior to entering the MSiA program.

Your experience with Marketing and Marketing Analysis will fit with our programs current dynamic. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  _____  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHello.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMy name is Chen SUI and I am thinking of applying to the MS in Analytics program at Northwestern University this year. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to prepare myself for the program and on how to become a strong candidate. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from Peking University, China, and a MS degree in Marketing Analysis from DePaul University, Chicago. And I have used SAS, R and STATA in my previous work. Also, I have worked as a marketing manager at a Chinese financial service start-up where I used data analysis to propose a marketing strategy. And I'm self learning Python now. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs the internet is now playing a more and more important role in people's lives, a large amount of data is generated everyday. Therefore, it would be extremely important to use data mining techniques to study and predict human behaviors. I think your program is great and I really appreciate the opportunity to study with you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd I have attached my resume for your review. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks you very much for your help and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n??

RE: Interested in MS in Analytics^Dear Khurram Ali Kahn:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question about setting up an appointment to discuss our program and admission process, my first recommendation is for you to sign up for out information session for November 15th at Noon CT. I have included the link below. This session is designed to answer your questions and give you insight into our program. We will discuss everything from application process to financial options. Our Associate Director will lead the discussion and then open the last 15mins to Q&A. If you have additional questions beyond that information session we will schedule a 15min phone call.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo provide you with some common questions we have about admissions please see below:\r\n\r\n1.       We do not enroll based on rolling admissions. We wait until applications have closed and then a panel will review the applicants. Candidates typically will not hear from our committee until February. \r\n\r\n2.       Out of the 32 candidates we select the top students for our fellowship, we have limited fellowships available and they are solely given on merit based. You do not need to fill out any further material for consideration for our fellowships. \r\n\r\n3.       The GRE is not a required component of our admissions process. Because we do not require it we do not have a true average for our enrolled students scores. \r\n\r\n4.       You need only provide pdf copies of  transcripts and any supplemental material (ie TOEFL, GRE, etc). Upon admittance to the program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: late application^Hello Kari:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question we do not allow students to enter in the winter. We begin an 8month industry project (required) in the Fall. By the time the winter comes the students have completed a third of the project. It is mandatory for graduation and therefore we must have everyone begin together in the fall. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

Inquiry-MS Analytics^Hello Hemdara:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I have seen your CV and read a little about your background and work experience. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question about admittance in spring, we are not structured for that time frame. Our program is a full-time 15month program which begins in the fall. We require all students in the 32 person cohort to begin in the fall because of our 8month Industry sponsored project. Students begin working on that in teams of 4 from day 1 of class. Due to this partnership we do not allow students to enter in the spring quarter. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHowever, you appear to be a very eager candidate with qualifications for our program and we would love to see your application for Fall 2014. We will begin in September and then graduate the following December 2015. The unique nature of our program will benefit you greatly.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Question regarding application references^Dear Max:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions about letters of recommendation please see below: \r\n\r\nWe require 3 letters of recommendation from people who have had supervisory experience over you in a professional and/or academic setting. \r\n\r\nAll writers are asked to address the following questions:\r\n\r\n*\thow they know the candidate and why they are qualified to assess the candidate's suitability for the program;\r\n*\tif they can identify any distinctive qualities and/or examples which highlight the candidate's suitability for the program;\r\n*\tif they can provide some point of comparison for the candidate against others who were in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe have a preference for letters of recommendation come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\n\r\n Years since completed undergraduate \r\n\r\n  Academic  \r\n\r\n  Professional \r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe application system will email your recommenders at the email address you provide. Recommenders will receive a request to address the questions outlined above as well as instructions on how to upload their completed letter into the application system. Recommenders may use standard word processing software for letters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Application Questions^Dear Vikas:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEither the GRE or GMAT test score is required for admission, we do require your test scores to be current, less than 2 years old. Admissions for this program is very competitive, we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions, the MSiA program is full-time for 15 months (including a required summer industry-focused internship). There are no online courses or part-time options available for this particular intensive program. Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working. You can find more information on that program here: http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/ <http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding our specific application requirements I encourage you to explore our program website at http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/ <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/>  and keep in touch on twitter xxx@xxx.xxx McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science\r\n\r\n2145 Sheridan Rd, E278\r\n\r\nEvanston, IL 60208\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: vikas bhardwaj xxx@xxx.xxx When is the next batch going to start and what is the application deadline for it?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nVikas Bhardwaj\r\n\r\n770-490-6043\r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/o=nuexch/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=vlr2122d7^EX^'vikas xxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Spring 2015 Application^Dear Alejandro;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we only accept fall enrollment in each academic year. Applications open for the 2015-2016 year on September 1, 2014. The Applications will close on January 15, 2014. Our curriculum was created as an intensive 15-month time frame, which allows for collaboration between members of the cohort. We do not accept Spring applications at this time. \r\n\r\nEither the GRE or GMAT test score is required for admission. The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year.\r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 2014.

Northwestern Analytics - Application Status^Dear Pavan;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your patience during the admissions process. Northwestern Universitys Master of Science in Analytics Admissions Committee has completed evaluation of waitlist candidates for the class of 2015. I regret to inform you that after our first round of admission, we are unable to offer you a position in the class. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe hope that you will understand that this decision is not a reflection of your abilities, but rather a reflection of the exceedingly high numbers we saw from this years application pool. During this admissions season, we saw a record number of over five hundred and fifty candidates apply to the entering cohort of thirty-two students. The majority of applicants could have been successful academically, but our committee was tasked with choosing a small class from a much larger applicant pool than our program had room to admit. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe very much appreciate the interest you have shown in the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University and wish you the best for the coming year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics Admissions Committee\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/o=nuexch/ou=Exchange Administrative Group xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northwestern Analytics - Application Status^Dear Mayank:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in admissions process. Northwestern Universitys Master of Science in Analytics Admissions Committee has completed evaluation of waitlist candidates for the class of 2015. I regret to inform you that after our first round of admission, we are unable to offer you a position in the class. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe hope that you will understand that this decision is not a reflection of your abilities, but rather a reflection of the exceedingly high numbers we saw from this years application pool. During this admissions season, we saw a record number of over five hundred and fifty candidates apply to the entering cohort of thirty-two students. The majority of applicants could have been successful academically, but our committee was tasked with choosing a small class from a much larger applicant pool than our program had room to admit. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe very much appreciate the interest you have shown in the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University and wish you the best for the coming year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics Admissions Committee\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/o=nuexch/ou=Exchange Administrative Group xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Application Problem^Dear Jesse\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, if you could provide an official website or statement from the university that English is the main language of your institution. I will mark it in your student account as a note.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Admission requirement query^Dear Russell;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.   The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, yes, either a  GRE or GMAT test score is required for admission. The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 2014.

RE: Masters Program at Northwestern University (Fall '14)^Dear Nandini:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. I would be happy to answer your questions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am very sorry to say that because of the high volume of application weve received this admissions season, we are unable to accommodate on-campus visits between now and our admissions decisions. Should you still want to plan a visit to campus and an opportunity to sit in on several classes after March 17, we would be happy to assist.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, I would be happy to schedule a 10 -15 minute call with you and the associate director to answer any questions that you might have about the program. Please let me know if this would be helpful. In regards to an information session, we will not be hosting another one during this application season. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Application Questions^Dear Alice;\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your two questions:\r\n1. With regards to your TOEFL score, you will not need to submit a TOEFL score as long as the degree granting institution (Univ. of Michigan) is an English speaking institution. \r\n2. Unfortunately, we currently do not offer a PhD in Analytics. We only provide the MS degree. If you are looking to go into academia with analytics, the IEMS department here at Northwestern offers an Analytics focus. That may be a better fit for you if you are looking to get a PhD. Currently, I do not know of any institutions which offers Analytics as a field for PhD's. \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session today  at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Northwestern University Master of Science in Analytics Program^Dear Tejaswini;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us at the MS in Analytics program at Northwestern University. In regards to your TOEFL score, my recommendation is to provide us with an ecopy the moment your TOEFL score has been issued. We can upload your ecopy until the official scores comes to our office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am confused by your second question, we do not provide teaching or research assistant positions in our program. The Master of Science in Analytics offers a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent (50%) of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional applications will need to be submitted for consideration. For more information in regards to financial aid and funding, I encourage you to explore those possibilities on our website, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know any additional questions your have before our admissions deadline on Feb 15th.\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Difficulty in completing recommendation Letter- NWU^Dear Hassan;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have noticed in your email your recommender has faxed their letter to (847) 491-8539. This is the general fax for McCormick School of Engineering and it is actually a black hole fax number for general McCormick. As listed in my signature, our fax is (847) 491-8005, in regards to this your recommender must list Attn: MS in Analytics for it to come to our program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe other option is for your recommender to email our program directly with their recommendation and I can upload your letter of reference from there. We have just received and email from Mohammed A. Al-Shoshan with a letter of reference for you. This letter has been uploaded to your account this morning. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the recommendation glitch in our application manager system.

RE: MSiA Transcript and GMAT scores^Hello Mariela,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delayed response time from our department. I have just gone into our application managing system and I see that your application is completed but was never submitted.

It appears as though you have completed your application and had not selected the Submit function which would take your application from N/A to and Active application. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat being said,  we have sent out our decisions and are close to hearing back from all of our admitted students, and we have a full waitlist and will not be able to offer you a place in our 2014 class.

RE: Prospective student^Dear Renato;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. We have an IELTS requirement of 7.0. You can email this account a scanned copy of your IELTS report to have it uploaded to your account.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: financial aid?^Dear Israel;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding financial support, we do not provide teaching or research assistant positions in our program. The Master of Science in Analytics offers a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent (50%) of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional applications will need to be submitted for consideration. For more information in regards to financial aid and funding, I encourage you to explore those possibilities on our website, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

MSiA Application Status^Hello Kelly,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize I missed your phone call, I am not working in the office this morning. We are several rounds through the application process, and unfortunately when we were pulling applications together we were working off of the applications listed as Submitted/Active. Therefore, we had not pulled together your application packet. I will speak with our admissions committee and see what we can do to review your application. I will be in contact with you today at some point to follow up. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI completely understand that our application system is less than user friendly, we are currently working to replace the current system. I will work on this and see if we can review your application before our decisions are released on Monday, March 17th. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics-NWU^Dear Rohit;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we are currently unable to accept students during our Spring term on campus (March-June). We only accept students annually to begin in the Fall (Sept). Due to our industry projects we are restricted to only accept our 32 students in one cohort. We require students to complete at 9month practicum project, a 10week internship, followed by a 3month capstone project. Due to the level of group work, we are unable to accept students outside of our first intake. \r\n\r\nWe would be happy to enroll you in our 2015-2016 cohort, however, which is a 15month fulltime program. For more information in regards to financial aid and funding, I encourage you to explore those possibilities on our website, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 2014. I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2015!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Masters of Science in Analytics^Dear Lawrence,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we have received an increasing number of applications each year since our programs inception. Currently, we have an acceptance rate just below 10%. We take into consideration your full application and your personal statement would be a welcome place for you to explain your circumstances and your passion for analytics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 2014. I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2016!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MS Analytics Application - Fall 2014^Dear Sahil;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the confusion. We do not use the GATS system for our applications.

However, we will not be updating the MAP system until decisions are made on March 18th. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we require a skype interview we will reach out to you in the coming week and schedule an appointment convenient for your schedule. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Admissions questions ^Dear Serena;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.  The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, The Master of Science in Analytics will admit only 32 of students each fall quarter. While this will undoubtedly mean that admission will be highly selective, it will also mean we can give appropriate attention to those who are admitted. We are aiming to foster a collaborative atmosphere within the program and believe that a small cohort of exceptionally talented and strongly motivated students will best enable us to achieve this. We have received an increase in applications each year since the inception of our program. We have an acceptance rate a little below 10%. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 2014.

RE: TOFEL^Dear Noor;\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September.\r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2015!\r\nVictoria L. Richmond\r\nProgram Assistant 3, Master of Science in Analytics\r\n\r\nNorthwestern University\r\nRobert R.

RE: career questions about MSiA^Dear Tien:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics program began with the 2012-2013 academic year; our first cohort is currently in their final stages and has not yet graduated. We are unable to provide the specific information you have requested. We will be looking to update the website with our students job placement information shortly. This field is expanding exponentially and there are fantastic job opportunities available to graduates of the Master of Science in Analytics program. Future job opportunities include: Lead analyst for a Fortune 500 firm, Statistical Modeling Analysts, Digital Strategy Analysts, Communications and Media Analysts, Systems Engineers, Consultants, or Entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease check our website in the upcoming month after graduation for our statistics on job placements and companies our students received offers from.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Application Help^Hi Jeremy,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for this. I can enter the system and remove the receipt of your GMAT score. To clarify the situation, the only individuals who have access to the application managing system are myself and a temporary hire. We had been uploading and updating student profiles in the system and she must have found your score report and attached it to your online record. However, I built your application packet and did not include your GMAT report so the admissions review committee will not see your scores. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI will remove the record today and you should see the change reflected within 24hours.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MS in Analytics Deadline Approaching^Dear Shashi;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe use a third party to collect our application fees.

RE: Simon Barres Transcripts^Dear Simon;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe do not actually upload the letters of recommendation, unless specifically asked by the recommender. Your recommenders have a link to upload on their own. Your application is still considered by our admissions committee despite having only 2 Letters of Recommendation. I have noted on your account the missing letter. If you could email them and ask if they will submit it (using the link) at their earliest convenience I will attach it ASAP. If there is any issue with the upload method, please have them email me individually with the missing letter and I will upload it manually on my end. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Simon Barres xxx@xxx.xxx Are you maybe still in the process of uploading it?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nSimon Barres\r\n\r\nOn Feb 17, 2014 9:41 AM," ""Master of Science in Analytics"" xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Admission query^Dear Tanvi:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning the TOEFL requirement, can you please provide a link or proof of the primary language of your school? I will mark it on your application notes for our reviewers to see if you fulfill this requirement and the TOEFL requirement will be waived.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: career questions about MSiA^Dear Tien:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics program began with the 2012-2013 academic year; our first cohort is currently in their final stages and has not yet graduated. We are unable to provide the specific information you have requested. We will be looking to update the website with our students job placement information shortly. This field is expanding exponentially and there are fantastic job opportunities available to graduates of the Master of Science in Analytics program. Future job opportunities include: Lead analyst for a Fortune 500 firm, Statistical Modeling Analysts, Digital Strategy Analysts, Communications and Media Analysts, Systems Engineers, Consultants, or Entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease check our website in the upcoming month after graduation for our statistics on job placements and companies our students received offers from.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Application^Dear Lan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). Since they are not required we do not give out minimums or averages.  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Prospective Student xxx@xxx.xxx sincerely,\r\n\r\nLan Ma\r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=OMA36151E^EX^Prospective xxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Master of Science in Analytics deadline inquiry^HelloLiu:\r\n\r\nI apologize for my delayed response time. We do look for our students to have some background in computer science. It seems as though you have knowledge of CS and I would be sure to mention it either on your resume or in your personal statement. The other way to have CS appear on your transcript is by taking classes such as CORESERA and including certificates from their programs in your resume.

RE: Questions about MS in Analytics^Dear Michael;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your questions, the MSiA program is full-time for 15 months (including a required summer industry-focused internship). There are no online courses or part-time options available for this particular intensive program. Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working. You can find more information on that program here: http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/ <http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Prospective Applicant^Hello Bella:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe accept 32 students a year. While this will undoubtedly mean that admission will be highly selective, it will also mean we can give appropriate attention to those who are admitted. We are aiming to foster a collaborative atmosphere within the program and believe that a small cohort of exceptionally talented and strongly motivated students will best enable us to achieve this. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile we have many students enrolled in our program form CS and EE backgrounds we do not limit our admissions process to those academic majors. We look to build a collaborative cohort each year with a variety of backgrounds and interests. We have not had students in our program with a similar background to yours and I would be sure to mention that in your personal statement. As an academic institution we are very interested in applying analytics in a wide variety of fields of interest. I would not look at your background as weaker or negative, but unique. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what other questions and concerns you have about applying to our program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MSiA Program Inquiry^Dear Lin\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Lin Li xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Application^Dear Lan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). Since they are not required we do not give out minimums or averages.  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Prospective Applicant^Hello Bella:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe accept 32 students a year. While this will undoubtedly mean that admission will be highly selective, it will also mean we can give appropriate attention to those who are admitted. We are aiming to foster a collaborative atmosphere within the program and believe that a small cohort of exceptionally talented and strongly motivated students will best enable us to achieve this. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile we have many students enrolled in our program form CS and EE backgrounds we do not limit our admissions process to those academic majors. We look to build a collaborative cohort each year with a variety of backgrounds and interests. We have not had students in our program with a similar background to yours and I would be sure to mention that in your personal statement. As an academic institution we are very interested in applying analytics in a wide variety of fields of interest. I would not look at your background as weaker or negative, but unique. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what other questions and concerns you have about applying to our program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

I am sure there was a delay in the mail (due to the rash of bad weather here in the US we have had our deliveries effected). Would you be able to provide me with an unofficial TOEFL score? We will accept a PDF of your ETS page and it will serve as a place holder in your application until the official score arrives. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to reviewing your application for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Recommendation Letters^Dear Yi;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, unfortunately, we have a very short turn around for applications. We pass off completed applications to our admissions committee the following week and there is not a lot of room in regards for late materials. \r\n\r\nIn regards to your Letters of Recommendation, my advice is that you tell them it is a rushed letter and they can email the letter to this address when it is finished and I will attach it until your application is passed to the admissions committee. If this is not possible, I would suggest finding an alternative recommender.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have additional questions to this information.\r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Clarification: Application for MS in business analytics at NorthWestern university^Dear Ram,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your additional materials to the Master of Science in Analytics at Northwestern University. We have uploaded them into our MAP system and it should be reflected in your account within 24 hours. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn response to your inquiry with your transcripts, due to the high volume we are receiving we cannot guarantee a confirmation email. However, you can track the status of your application in the MAP system (application system) check list which we will update as we receive your materials. I am a little concerned with timing however in relation to your transcript. Currently, due to nationwide bad weather we have had our post delayed. We do accept scanned copies of your transcript. I can upload that into our system on your behalf and we will replace them with your official copies upon their arrival. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions regarding the MS in Analytics program.

RE: MSiA Program^Dear Richard,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, unfortunately, we have a very short turn around for applications. We pass off completed applications to our admissions committee the following week and there is not a lot of room in regards for late materials. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat being said, we do have a few policies which will allow you to complete your application rather quickly. We do not request official transcripts while in the application process, we only ask for official mailed and sealed transcripts after you have been accepted to the program. The same idea applies to any additional materials (GRE/TOEFL scores, which are not required) we only ask for a PDF of your scores. In regards to your Letters of Recommendation, my advice is that you tell them it is a rushed letter and they can email the letter to this address when it is finished and I will attach it until your application is passed to the admissions committee. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have additional questions to this information.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: admissions^Dear Sumeet;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question concerning the GRE; neither the GRE nor the GMAT are required for admission to the Master of Science in Analytics but we will accept scores from applicants who choose to provide them to us. We believe we can draw enough information from the remainder of an application package to make an assessment of a candidate's suitability for the program. In some cases, supplying a standardized test score may be recommended, particularly in instances where a high score might be indicative of abilities not demonstrated elsewhere in the application. During admissions for the 2013-14 cohort, approximately 75% of candidates provided scores. Unfortunately, we cannot accept any additional materials after Feb 15th. We have a very small window of time for our reviewers to evaluate applicants before they are provided offer letters, therefore we will be creating student applicant packets for completed applications directly after the 15th. Your application is complete without you sitting for the GMAT. \r\n\r\nIn regards to your question concerning your transcripts from India, we do not require official transcripts until after you have been admitted to the program. Our admissions committee can evaluate scanned pdf copies of your transcript. Due to the approaching deadline, I would recommend you to email us at xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Sumeet Aneja xxx@xxx.xxx You must submit official, sealed transcripts mailed directly from the University to the MAP office\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks, Sumeet\r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=OMA36151E^EX^Sumeet xxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To answer your question concerning the GRE; neither the GRE nor the GMAT are required for admission to the Master of Science in Analytics but we will accept scores from applicants who choose to provide them to us. In your question, I believe you have reported your score results in the Academic Credentials we will not evaluate based on that information unless we are provided an official copy from ETS. \r\n\r\nOur GRE code is 3672.\r\n\r\nThis being said, unfortunately, ETS takes a minimum of 10 business days to mail out scores. Due to the fast approaching deadline my recommendation to you is to provide us with a PDF from ETS acknowledging your score. This can be created from your ETS profile. Please send us some form of your score from the ETS site and it will stand in place of you score until we receive your official ETS score.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Information on employment^Dear Piyush;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we have just graduated our first cohort and have not yet released our industry statistics. We are awaiting some information from students before we publish on our site. However, I can tell you that before our students graduated 93% already accepted jobs, and after graduation 100% have received job offers. In regards to names of companies who have hired from MSiA, we have a list of companies on our website, page linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/index.html> , who offered our students internships over the summer. 90% of these internships produced job offers to the students who were at the respective companies. A few students declined those positions, but that can provide you with an idea of which companies have recruited with us in the past year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to reviewing your application for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

We have uploaded them into our MAP system and it should be reflected in your account within 24 hours. The scanned version of your transcript is the only requirement for your application, we will ask for an official transcript if you are accepted into the program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions regarding the MS in Analytics program. We will announce our admission decisions on March 18th. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding your GRE score. My understanding is that if can take up to 10 business days for a GRE score to arrive. My suggestion would be for you to send us a PDF ecopy of your score in the ETS site (you should be able to download a secure PDF, if not any version of your score in PDF format is acceptable). When we receive your official score I will attach that to your file. However, until we receive a score we will not evaluate your GRE score report. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe look forward to reviewing your application. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Years of study^Hello Pradeep;\r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in response time from our department. We are glad that there is an interest in our program, analytics is a growing field and our goal is to identify and assess the opportunities, needs and constraints for data usage within an organizational context; integrate information technology and data science to maximize the value of data; design innovative and creative data analytics solutions; communicate clearly and persuasively to a variety of audiences; lead analytics teams and projects.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning years of study and prerequisites, we look for graduation from an accredited university with a bachelors degree. Traditionally, we have accepted students from 4-year undergraduate programs, but that is not a requirement for our course. We require a minimum of a 3.0 GPA, 3 letters of recommendation, and a TOEFL/IELTS test. The GRE is recommended for students who feel that their quantitative abilities are not conveyed in their application, and when it strengthens a candidate. \r\n\r\nWe do not require applicants to have background knowledge with all of the industry tools we use, such as Cognos, SAS, SPSS, SQL Tableau etc. We offer a two week boot camp before the fall quarter. We have industry representatives come to campus and train our students with these tools so they are prepared for their course work. We look for candidates with strong quantitative backgrounds, specifically stats, calculus, and algebra.\r\n\r\nAgain I apologize for the delay in responding to you, please let me know what further questions you have and I will answer them to the best of my abilities. We do offer an information session where your friends daughter can listen to our Associate Program director break down admissions and our program, which will then open up to a Q&A. The next information session is Nov. 15th at noon CST.

The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Question from South Korea^Hello Jay:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions please see below:\r\n\r\n1.       To answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions. \r\n\r\n2.       Both GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJay Lim\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSent from Windows Mail\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Ellen Zaitchyk transcript - Lviv Polytechnic Institute^Dear Ellen;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3144 is the code for our program. We should receive your scores shortly. Typically ETS will bundle scores together and we dont receive them as individual test scores. Due to the recent rash of winter storms our mail has been delayed and not delivered, hopefully, the next batch of scores will have your TOEFL score included. We have had a few students select a general admissions Northwestern University code from ETS, as opposed to the MSiA program specific code of 3144, and I misunderstood your question. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the meantime I will mark that we have received a copy of your TOEFL scores and you will see it reflected in your student account within 24hour. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAgain I apologize for misunderstanding your original question, as long as you selected 3144 your report will reach the MS in Analytics program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MSiA Program Questions^Dear Joanna;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question in regards to management classes, there is some flexibility in the courses students take, but we are not focused on Management in our course, if this is something you are interested in I encourage you to look at our Master of Engineering Management, linked here. <http://mem.northwestern.edu/> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. We will accept student reported GRE scores in the form of a PDF copy of your scores.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Enquiry - M.S. in Analytics^Dear Krushnan\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions. Test scores must be less than two years old at the date of matriculation (for the 2014-15 cohort, this will be September 23, 2014). The minimum acceptable score for the TOEFL is 85 (Internet based test) and for the IELTS, 7.0. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MSiA Prospective student question^Dear Shiva;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I would love to answer your questions, I apologize for the delay in our response time. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions; \r\n\r\n1.       With regards to anything related to visas we suggest students to research the Northwestern University Internationals Offices website. They have an entire staff focused on all of the laws and rules associated with visas. We prefer not to provide any advice or information in this regard in case we do not give you correct information. Their website is linked here.\r\n\r\n2.       Each student will complete 3 industry provided projects while they attend our program. Our Practicum project and Capstone project are not paid projects for the students. These are used to learn and develop your skills to make you successful in the workplace. They are paired with your classes and you will learn and develop skills to accompany these projects. However, you are able to negotiate your payment for the internship in the summer quarter. We allow students to choose any internship they would like in any industry (as long as it fulfills an analytics requirement) and they negotiate their summer salary.\r\n\r\n3.       In regards to selection of projects, our director selects 8 companies and company supplied projects for the practicum assignment. Students then apply to us with the projects they would like to work on and we then assign students to one of the projects. Projects cross all industry and fields. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program. We are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: question about application^Dear Shannon;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. Test scores must be less than two years old at the date of matriculation (for the 2014-15 cohort, this will be September 23, 2014). The minimum acceptable score for the TOEFL is 85 (Internet based test) and for the IELTS, 7.0. Our TOEFL code is 3144. In regards to your work experience, we have students who come from 1year to 18years of work experience in our program (I have included a class breakdown in this email).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MS in Analytics admission application related queries.^Dear Archana;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in our response time. Thank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  We do not have an official cut off for the GRE, our only advice is if you think your score is high enough to quantify and display your quantitative knowledge I encourage you to submit it. The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. In regards to our TOEFL requirement, we ask for you score above an 85. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn regards to your question of a statement of financial support, we do not require it for our application process. For more information on application materials and our application process I encourage you to look at our webpage, linked here <http://analytics-dev.tech.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/materials.html> .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Application^Dear Lan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). Since they are not required we do not give out minimums or averages.  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

Our admissions committee will be in contact with you if they require a skype interview, regarding any lingering questions. But we do not have a policy for interviews currently. However, we will not ask for students to come on campus for interviews, all interviews conducted will be via skype. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any remaining questions.\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MSiA program^Dear Gayatri;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to me with your concerns regarding the MS in Analytics Program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we have not finalized the salary information for our first cohort yet. We will be advertising our job placement information in the coming weeks on our website. I know this is unhelpful for you as a current applicant for the next year. We do have a list of internships our students took over the summer and many students chose to take full time positions within those companies. I encourage you to look at that list for an example of the types of companies our students work at. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know any remaining questions your may have in regards to the MS in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Application^Dear Lan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). Since they are not required we do not give out minimums or averages.  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Prospective Student xxx@xxx.xxx sincerely,\r\n\r\nLan Ma\r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=OMA36151E^EX^Prospective xxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Questions for applying master in analytics program^Dear Wangyang:\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n1.  To answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions.\r\n2.  Both GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. We do not have a code currently for the GRE. We ask for you to submit a scanned copy to this email address which we keep for our records. Since it is not a requirement  and there is no formal cutoff score for the GRE we do not release or track student information. Only submit your GRE score if you believe it will fill a hole in your transcript and prove your quantitative prowess. \r\n\r\n The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Pre-requisites for the Masters of Science in Analytics.^Dear Amit:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nWhen we evaluate candidates we are typically looking for a background in quantitative classes (such as statistics, linear algebra etc) and some Computer science background. We do not expect you to be an expert at programing, and we encourage a diverse background in our students, but we do look to see what experience applicants have with programming. We run a 2 week boot camp at the beginning of our academic calendar where we run a training on different programs we use, ie SAS, SPSS, Cognos, Tableau etc. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Admission mathematical requirements in Master of Science in Analytics program^Dear Maxiao:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo address your concerns about your academic background, we accept students from a wide variety of academic interests. I have included our student profile below, but we have 28% of our students from Economics backgrounds. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RE: GRE score report not reflecting in Checklist^Dear Namratha;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question about transcripts, please email us a scanned copy. I will upload this in at least 3-10 business days and it will be reflected in your application checklist. Our admissions review committee only requires a scanned version of your transcript. However, if you are accepted into our program we will require you to send us an official transcript for matriculation. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn regards to your GRE score; as of January 24th we did not have an official code with the GRE. If you submitted your GRE score to Northwestern University it would be given to the central university admissions and we will not receive it in our office, there is nothing to distinguish which program you are applying to using Northwesterns code. We have just opened a code with the GRE (I apologize for the delay) and it is 3672. If you would like to have the GRE send us a report please use this code to reference our specific program at Northwestern University. However, this year due to the delay in the code, we will accept a scanned pdf of your GRE to upload into our system. If you would like to include that in an email I will update your account. Emailing us a scanned version, may be the quickest way to see your scores updated in the MAP system. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI do note that you emailed us your transcript on 1/23. I will be uploading this to our system and you should see the change on your account within 24hours. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe look forward to reviewing your application!\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Question about TOEFL^Dear Zhihao;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we only require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction, so, you would not be required to submit scores. We accept scanned transcripts for the application process, and should you be accepted, it would be an acceptance contingent on receiving original transcripts from each of your degree-granting institutions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: GRE department Code^Dear Qian \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in our response to your question.

RE: Institution code for sending official score of GRE^Dear Abhishek;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in our response to your question. We had hopes of receiving a GRE code sooner, but were delayed in the process.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning the GRE; neither the GRE nor the GMAT are required for admission to the Master of Science in Analytics but we will accept scores from applicants who choose to provide them to us. We believe we can draw enough information from the remainder of an application package to make an assessment of a candidate's suitability for the program. In some cases, supplying a standardized test score may be recommended, particularly in instances where a high score might be indicative of abilities not demonstrated elsewhere in the application. During admissions for the 2013-14 cohort, approximately 75% of candidates provided scores. \r\n\r\nOur GRE code is 3672.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions regarding the MS in Analytics program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe look forward to reviewing your application. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: May I get the institution codes ?^Dear Mengjie;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in our response to your question. We had hopes of receiving a GRE code sooner, but were delayed in the process.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning the GRE; neither the GRE nor the GMAT are required for admission to the Master of Science in Analytics but we will accept scores from applicants who choose to provide them to us. We believe we can draw enough information from the remainder of an application package to make an assessment of a candidate's suitability for the program. In some cases, supplying a standardized test score may be recommended, particularly in instances where a high score might be indicative of abilities not demonstrated elsewhere in the application. During admissions for the 2013-14 cohort, approximately 75% of candidates provided scores. \r\n\r\nOur GRE code is 3672.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions regarding the MS in Analytics program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe look forward to reviewing your application. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Inquiries of Master of Science in Analytics^Dear Erica;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions please see below:\r\n\r\n1.       We will waive your TOEFL/IELTS requirement, please provide me with a link to your schools website where they state that English is the language of instruction. \r\n\r\n2.       We do not have any pre-requisites for our course, we look for applicants who have a background in quantitative courses (statistics, calculus, linear algebra etc) and some IT/programming background.\r\n\r\n3.       To answer your question regarding financial support, the Master of Science in Analytics offers a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent (50%) of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional applications will need to be submitted for consideration. For more information in regards to financial aid and funding, I encourage you to explore those possibilities on our website, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n4.       In regards to your GRE score, please email us your unofficial scores and I will attach that to your file. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Letters of Recommendation^Dear Yunshi;\r\n\r\nI have just gone into your account to check the status of your recommendation letters. On our end in your application, I see three letters submitted. We have received letters from Glann Cerosaletti, Maria McDermott, and S.R.S Rao Poduri. Are these the correct recommenders? I am not positive why you do not see the three letters on your checklist. I have reported the error to IT. However, as long as these are your three letters then your application is set with references. Currently, we are missing your Transcripts and Application fee. \r\n\r\nHave a wonderful day, please let me know if you have more concerns about your application. \r\nVictoria L.

RE: Letters of Recommendation^Dear Yunshi;\r\n\r\nI have just gone into your account to check the status of your recommendation letters. On our end in your application, I see three letters submitted. We have received letters from Glann Cerosaletti, Maria McDermott, and S.R.S Rao Poduri. Are these the correct recommenders? I am not positive why you do not see the three letters on your checklist. I have reported the error to IT. However, as long as these are your three letters then your application is set with references. Currently, we are missing your Transcripts and Application fee. \r\n\r\nHave a wonderful day, please let me know if you have more concerns about your application. \r\nVictoria L.

RE: Application question^Dear Geng;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.  The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDue to the approaching deadline of Feb 15th, I encourage you to scan us a PDF of your resume.

The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MS Business analytics^Dear Divyaa;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions please see below:\r\n\r\n1.       We enroll 32 students for each Fall cohort. For information on our current student profiles I encourage you to look at our student page on our website, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/index.html> .\r\n\r\n2.       In regards to tuition, the 2013-2014 academic year costs $15,038 per quarter.

RE: MS in Business Analytics : Fall 2014^Dear S Nayak:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n1.       We are a masters program housed under the Industrial Engineering and Management Studies department. Because we are we do qualify as a STEM program. \r\n\r\n2.       Tuition Fees <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> : For the 2013-2014 it will be $15,038/qtr. Your tuition will be due for the fall, winter, and spring quarters but not in the summer. \r\n\r\n3.       We offer a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional application will need to be submitted for consideration. Please visit the Tuition and Fees page on our website for more opportunities of financial support within the Northwestern School system. We only control the Fellowships offered by our program. \r\n\r\n4.       We encourage you to submit a GRE score if you believe it will help prove your quantitative knowledge to our admissions committee. If you feel your academic transcript does not show your quantitative background then I would suggest submitting the GRE. 75% of our accepted students had submitted their scores. This is not a requirement for consideration for our program, nor for our Fellowship.\r\n\r\n5.       Estimated Cost of Living: We tell students to budget around $22,000 for living expenses. There is a full breakdown of our costs on the Tuition page of our website. \r\n\r\n6.       In terms of Financial documents, we do not require those. That is outside of our office, if you have questions I would suggest reaching out to the International Office to discuss obtaining an I20\r\n\r\n7.       Currently we are graduating our inaugural cohort. We do not yet have any job placement statistics to provide. Once our students have graduated we will be updating our website with that information. Please check back with us at the end of December. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Prospective student ^Dear Syed;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics questions^Hello Manjola,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize it has taken so long for our department to respond to your request. We are very eager for you to see our campus and our program. Your request was unique, in that we do not usually allow students to sit in on classes. I know you are eager to come in this week but due to the current academic calendar it would not be the best time. Students are in midterms and they will be testing all week. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe want to offer you one of the following two options:\r\n\r\n1.       In January we have a guest speaker coming for a seminar lecture, we would love to have you come and visit, sit in on our seminar series and a class, as well as a meeting with our associate director. \r\n\r\n2.       If you want to visit in the fall, you can take a campus tour and have a 15min meeting with our Associate Director. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know which option works best for your calendar. Again I apologize for the tardiness in response from our office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Northwestern University: Master of Science in Analytics Program - Applications are now being accepted for the 2014-2015 cohort^Dear Santosh;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I have included the directions from our website in regards to submitting your additional application materials, if you would like more detail I encourage you to look at our prospective students page, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/materials.html> . \r\n\r\nGRE and GMAT (not compulsory, submission details below)\r\n\r\nNeither the GRE nor the GMAT are required for admission to the Master of Science in Analytics but we will accept scores from applicants who choose to provide them to us. We believe we can draw enough information from the remainder of an application package to make an assessment of a candidate's suitability for the program. In some cases, supplying a standardized test score may be recommended, particularly in instances where a high score might be indicative of abilities not demonstrated elsewhere in the application. During admissions for the 2013-14 cohort, approximately 75% of candidates provided scores. \r\n\r\nInstitution codes for the GRE and GMAT will be forthcoming. Until posted otherwise, please email scanned copies of the report to xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nOn Fri, Dec 6, 2013 at 1:16 AM, Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx > xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n                                       Find me , Hear Me xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Request for Information - M.S. in Data Science^Dear Naman;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in my response time to your inquiry. To answer your question, we are unable to accept students at any time outside of a fall start. Due to the nature of our program our students work as a cohort. They enter the year together and begin a 9month practicum project which ties into course work throughout their first 3 quarters. There are no online courses or part-time options available for this particular intensive program. Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics deadline inquiry^Dear Liu\r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\tAcademic\tProfessional\r\n0\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\r\n1-3\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t1\r\n3-5\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t2\r\n5+\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Prerequisites for the program Master of Science in Analytics^Dear Anshul:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. We look for applicants to have experience with calculus, statistics, and some programming languages.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Question for Enrollment^Dear Xin;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we only allow students to enroll in the fall each year. We enroll our students as a cohort due to class work and the nature of our program. Unfortunately, our applications open in the fall and will close again in February. I encourage you to explore our curriculum page on our website  for more information on our courses and program design. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MSiA 2014^Dear Anurag;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, please see the following:\r\n\r\n1.       We have suggested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n2.       Tuition is $15,038 per quarter, you will be in classes for 4 academic quarters. However,  during the summer you will not have to pay tuition and you can take a paid internship to offset the cost. For more information on our tuition and fees I encourage you to investigate our page on the website, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Thanks for your help!^Dear Henry;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo answer your question, please see the following:\r\n\r\n1.       The following is the background by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences. We do look for our applicants to have a foundation in calculus and statistics.\r\n\r\n2.       Since our applicants are not required to give us a GRE/GMAT score we do not release averages. However, if you believe that your score will help prove your quantitative background in a way your transcript cannot, I encourage your to include your score in your application.\r\n\r\n3.       Our students have a wide variety of interests and we support their various fields of analytics. We have students looking into finance, health care, gaming, athletics, and social media. For a list of internships our students found please look at our Current Students webpage, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/index.html> . We will be listing job placement information shortly. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics deadline inquiry^Dear Yu\r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\tAcademic\tProfessional\r\n0\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\r\n1-3\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t1\r\n3-5\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t2\r\n5+\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics deadline inquiry^Dear Yu\r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\tAcademic\tProfessional\r\n0\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\r\n1-3\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t1\r\n3-5\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t2\r\n5+\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Info on Masterns in Analytics^Dear Sayan;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see the following for answers to your questions;\r\n\r\n1.       Financial Aid Information: We provide a limited number of fellowships to students. This fellowship will cover 50% of tuition costs during the 4 quarters of classes. We select the top students to provide this fellowship, there is not additional application for the fellowship. If you are looking for more information in regards to financial aid our website has links to various options outside of our program for scholarships, linked here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n2.       Accommodations: Many of our students chose to rent apartments in Evanston or in Chicago. However, the university does offer graduate student housing. We leave student accommodations entirely up to the applicants. \r\n\r\n3.       We ask for a minimum of 7.0 for IELTS reports. Your 8.5 score is above our minimum. We accept scanned copies of your IELTS score.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Mrinmayi Gadre Official Transcripts for MSiA 2014^Dear Mrinmayi;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have just looked at your application and noticed we have still not received your TOEFL scores via ETS. Your scanned copy of the GRE score will suffice for application purposes, however, we will require your TOEFL score. We can accept a scanned copy if that would be the quickest way for us to receive it. We have had some difficulty receiving scores from ETS, many candidates sent them to Northwestern University, and not specifically the MSiA program (code number 3144). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is not a problem, but I want to make sure we have your completed application before we begin reviewing our applicants on February 15th. Our decisions will be announced on March 17th.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHappy New Year and Good Luck in 2014. If you should have any further questions please let me know.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Enquiries about TOEFL exam^Dear Christy:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.

RE: Queries regarding applications for Fall 2014^Dear Auroshis:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I apologize for the delay in our response time.  The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions. \r\n\r\n1.       We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n2.       We will accept a scanned copy of an official letter from your college stating the medium of instruction as English, and I will mark it in your application as a waiver for your TOEFL score. \r\n\r\n3.       Please email your scores to this email address. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: Application Questions^Dear Yi:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the cost of $15,000 per quarter are for the four quarters you are taking classes at Northwestern, therefore it does not include the period when you are in your summer internship. Our students typically find summer internships which are paid and therefore have a source of income to offset the tuition cost during the summer. We provide a great deal of help to our students when it comes to the internship. Many students enter the program with an idea of what field of analytics they would like to go into, and therefore we set up opportunities for them to interview. We also send out a resume book which allows companies to view our students and contact them. But you are required to have an internship in our program.\r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: Application Questions^Dear Yi:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the cost of $15,000 per quarter are for the four quarters you are taking classes at Northwestern, therefore it does not include the period when you are in your summer internship. Our students typically find summer internships which are paid and therefore have a source of income to offset the tuition cost during the summer. We provide a great deal of help to our students when it comes to the internship. Many students enter the program with an idea of what field of analytics they would like to go into, and therefore we set up opportunities for them to interview. We also send out a resume book which allows companies to view our students and contact them. But you are required to have an internship in our program.\r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Master of Science in Analytics deadline inquiry^Dear Liu\r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning references, we have requested academic references but that is only a suggestion for applicants. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\tAcademic\tProfessional\r\n0\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\r\n1-3\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t1\r\n3-5\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t2\r\n5+\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: MSiA Program^Dear Matthew:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.  The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to below for answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.       Typically we do not release this information about our students. We require a minimum GPA of 3.0. Since we do not require a GRE we do not provide average scores, and we require a minimum of 85 in our TOEFL scores, to gauge the caliber of students admitted into our program I encourage you to look at our Current students page which provides an effective class profile.\r\n\r\n2.       Due to the project based nature of our program we require our students to graduate within the 15months they are enrolled in our program. We are a cohort based system. You will be a part of a 9month industry practicum project, which solves real world issues with business. Then you enter a required 10 week internship, where you will apply your knowledge of analytics in an internship setting. Your final project is a capstone project which is a 3month industry supplied project where you demonstrate what you have learnt at Northwestern University. Each of these projects are team based and are required to be completed by deadline. \r\n\r\n3.       Each year we aim to enroll 32 students to our cohort. \r\n\r\n4.       I encourage you to provide recommendations from whomever gives us the best sense of your analytics background. The guidelines on the website are a suggestion, but we would like to have a rounded understanding of what your analytics background is and what exposure/experience you have had in analytics.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Regarding MSiA 2015-16^Dear Mahadevan\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. I apologize for the delay in my response. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions regarding scholarships, our program offers a limited number of fellowships to our top candidates. The fellowship will cover fifty (50%) percent of tuition costs for the four quarters you are studying at Northwestern University. We do not require an additional application for the opportunity to get a fellowship, your application is the basis of our evaluation for a suitable candidate for our Fellowship.

RE: Application Deadline^Dear Rohan;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question; we do not accept students on a rolling admissions. We will not begin reviewing applications until after February 15th. No matter when you submit your application (as long as all of your materials arrive before the deadline) you will be given an equal advantage of all our applicants. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the three academic references are only a suggestion. We have a preference for letters of recommendation to come from academic sources but do recognize that in some circumstances this may be difficult to achieve or it may be that a recommendation letter from a professional source is entirely relevant and appropriate. As a rough guide, the table below outlines a recommended balance between professional and academic letters of recommendation, based only on number of years since the completion of an undergraduate degree. \r\n\r\nYears since completed undergraduate\r\n\r\nAcademic\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n1-3\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n3-5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n5+\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe application system will email your recommenders at the email address you provide. Recommenders will receive a request to address the questions outlined above as well as instructions on how to upload their completed letter into the application system. Recommenders may use standard word processing software for letters. For more information I encourage you to look at our website under Prospective Students. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: MSA degree^Dear Michael:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. [INSERT SPECIFIC QUESTION ANSWERS HERE] The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions, the MSiA program is full-time for 15 months (including a required summer industry-focused internship). There are no online courses or part-time options available for this particular intensive program. Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working. You can find more information on that program here: http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/\r\n\r\nFor information on tuition and funding options I encourage you to explore our website, http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html . It gives a full breakdown of pricing.\r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Master of Sc. in Analytics^Dear Yoong:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n1. We began our program in 2012, and on Thursday, December 12th we graduated our first cohort. \r\n\r\n2. We accept 32 students each year into our program, we do not anticipate expanding the number of students accepted in the near future. \r\n\r\n3. We are entirely separate from the School of Continuing Studies. We do not share faculty or courses. The SCSs MS in Predictive Analytics is a part time program which allows students to take classes online and finish their degree on their schedule. Our program is a full time Professional Masters program which requires you to take our classes (with some flexibility) and finish within 15months. The hallmark feature of our program is our industry collaboration. We require our students to complete 3 industry sponsored projects which they will take alongside their class work. \r\n\r\n4. In regards to your resume, I have included a student profile breakdown below. Our students have a wide variety of academic backgrounds. You exposure to computer science in industry will translate in your resume and provide you with the necessary IT background for this program. \r\n\r\n5. We will not be able to accept your GRE score. We close our applications on February 15th and evaluate our applicants and provide our decisions on March 18th. It is not a requirement and your application will be reviewed by our committee. \r\n\r\n6. We provide a merit based fellowship, which will cover 50% of your tuition fee. There is no additional material required to apply for the fellowship. We use your general program application as an application for our fellowship. I encourage you to research more funding opportunities on our website, linked here. <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html>  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: MS - Analytics^Dear Abdul;\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding tuition fees, we do not have a separate tuition fee for international students. The Tuition Fees and Scholarships page applies to all of our students. I have linked that page on our website here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> . Our tuition numbers from this past quarter is $15,038. Our students expect to pay around $85,000-$90,000 total in our program. We offer a limited number of scholarships each year which will pay 50% of the tuition each quarter. These fellowships are entirely merit based. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding TOEFL requirements, your undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan will serve as a TOEFL waiver. I will mark this email correspondence in your file. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Query on MS in Analytics program^Dear Saurabh,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to me with your questions concerning admissions to the MS in Analytics Program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions:\r\n\r\n1.       If you could include in your application or in a note/comment that your undergraduate degree was taught in English then you will not need to submit a TOEFL score.  \r\n\r\n2.       In terms of Financial Aid, we offer a limited number of fellowships each year within the department. We evaluate the student cohort on a whole and offer them to our top candidates, your application to our program serves as an application for a fellowship. The fellowship will pay for half of your tuition for the 4 quarters you will be studying at Northwestern University. If you are interested in more Financial Aid options I encourage you to look into options within McCormick and at Northwestern. We only control the few in our department, and any additional financial support will need to be applied for on your own. I have linked out page with additional links here <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html> .\r\n\r\n3.       Admissions are determined after the applications have closed in February. We do not operate on rolling admissions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Request for Information on the Master of Science in Analytics program^Dear Shalini\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMaster of Science in Analytics tuition for the 2013-2014 academic year will be $15,038 per quarter. Tuition is due for the fall, winter and spring quarters but not the summer.  \r\n\r\nAdditional expenses should be considered:\r\n\r\n          On campus annual cost of living expenses of $22,0,\r\n\r\n          Approximately $500-$1,000 for textbooks,\r\n\r\n          $3,067 for Northwestern University health insurance,\r\n\r\n          $5,000 miscellaneous (personal, transportation, etc). \r\n\r\nThe total cost of the Master of Science in Analytics degree will be about $85,000 to $90,000 depending on the student's needs. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions concerning financial aid The Master of Science in Analytics offers a limited number of fellowships each year covering fifty percent (50%) of the tuition expenses. They are awarded during the application process to select students and are based on merit, no additional applications will need to be submitted for consideration. In addition to the fellowships offered directly through the program, Master of Science in Analytics students may be eligible for other types of support. Resources may be found at the McCormick School of Engineering Fellowships and Internships <http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/graduates/current_student_resources/fellowships_internships/index.html>  page or at Northwestern University's Office of Fellowships <http://www.northwestern.edu/fellowships/> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

Our program is a full time 15month program which operates on a cohort system. Unfortunately, that means we are unable to accommodate your request.

RE: Question about application^Dear Liyu:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. To answer your question, we do not exclusively look for individuals who are graduating or in industry. We have accepted students who have an MS degree.  We currently have one student who has his PhD in Mathematics. I have included a student profile below in this email. I also encourage you to look at our Current Students <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/index.html>  page on our site. This page provides a profile of the candidates we are looking for. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Information about MSiA program at McCormick,Northwestern.^Hello Abhitab;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI would be happy to answer your questions! \r\n\r\n1.       In terms of flexibility of the program, we have so room for students to build what they want. If you have redundancies with courses we offer (say Java) then we will allow you to substitute with an approved course. Some quarters are more flexible than others, but if you are coming for the analytics education we have built all of the necessary courses and skill classes you will need into the curriculum. What were your concerns with the curriculum? Some of our students who are looking to tailor the program to their own research interests, will take on extra projects with Diego Klabjan. He has a great deal of industry projects happening at one time, currently 18 of our students have taken on additional projects to help pursue their fields of interest. \r\n\r\n2.       Our classrooms are far from competitive. Our program is structured to be collaborative. Our main goal is to incorporate business skills in our classroom environment. We give our students ample opportunities to work on group projects and practicum project. Since the business world is built with analytical teams, we expect our students to be able to work in that environment. \r\n\r\n3.       In terms of networking, we offer a weekly social on Thursdays. We invite companies to come on to campus and recruit from our students. Our students then participate in a relaxed and informal networking session. We also offer lunches to network with industry contacts who come onto campus. \r\n\r\n4.       In the first 3 quarters our students are spending about 20+ hours a week attending classes, 5-10hours on their practicum project, and the remaining time is for them to complete project work and any additional tasks they have taken on. We typically build in days for working into their schedule when they will not have any classes. But their last quarter (the following Fall) our students are in class for 20 hours and working on their capstone project for about 20hours. \r\n\r\n5.       Students do have downtime, some try to get involved with campus activities and they will go to football games together, but it is entirely up to the students what they do as a group in their free time. As the above answer indicates it is difficult for the students to have lots of free time to take part in extra activities but they do most things in a big group.\r\n\r\n6.       Evanston is a mixture of college students, families, and young working professionals. There are many students in our program who have brought their families with them and they are able to find everything they need within Evanston. There is plenty of housing to accommodate and it is a suburb of Chicago, and very family friendly.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are looking for more detail to any of these questions. I am happy to help!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L. Richmond\r\n\r\nProgram Assistant, Master of Science in Analytics\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNorthwestern University\r\n\r\nRobert R.

RE: Information about MSiA program at McCormick,Northwestern.^Hello Abhitab;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI would be happy to answer your questions! \r\n\r\n1.       In terms of flexibility of the program, we have so room for students to build what they want. If you have redundancies with courses we offer (say Java) then we will allow you to substitute with an approved course. Some quarters are more flexible than others, but if you are coming for the analytics education we have built all of the necessary courses and skill classes you will need into the curriculum. What were your concerns with the curriculum? Some of our students who are looking to tailor the program to their own research interests, will take on extra projects with Diego Klabjan. He has a great deal of industry projects happening at one time, currently 18 of our students have taken on additional projects to help pursue their fields of interest. \r\n\r\n2.       Our classrooms are far from competitive. Our program is structured to be collaborative. Our main goal is to incorporate business skills in our classroom environment. We give our students ample opportunities to work on group projects and practicum project. Since the business world is built with analytical teams, we expect our students to be able to work in that environment. \r\n\r\n3.       In terms of networking, we offer a weekly social on Thursdays. We invite companies to come on to campus and recruit from our students. Our students then participate in a relaxed and informal networking session. We also offer lunches to network with industry contacts who come onto campus. \r\n\r\n4.       In the first 3 quarters our students are spending about 20+ hours a week attending classes, 5-10hours on their practicum project, and the remaining time is for them to complete project work and any additional tasks they have taken on. We typically build in days for working into their schedule when they will not have any classes. But their last quarter (the following Fall) our students are in class for 20 hours and working on their capstone project for about 20hours. \r\n\r\n5.       Students do have downtime, some try to get involved with campus activities and they will go to football games together, but it is entirely up to the students what they do as a group in their free time. As the above answer indicates it is difficult for the students to have lots of free time to take part in extra activities but they do most things in a big group.\r\n\r\n6.       Evanston is a mixture of college students, families, and young working professionals. There are many students in our program who have brought their families with them and they are able to find everything they need within Evanston. There is plenty of housing to accommodate and it is a suburb of Chicago, and very family friendly.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are looking for more detail to any of these questions. I am happy to help!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L. Richmond\r\n\r\nProgram Assistant, Master of Science in Analytics\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNorthwestern University\r\n\r\nRobert R.

RE: MS in Analytics^Dear Rahul:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: the application fee is missing^Hello Wanyan,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt Northwestern we use a separate system to pay for application fees.

RE: can u please tell me the eligibility to apply masters full time course in your university^Dear Rama Krishna:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding requirements/eligibility:\r\n\r\n*\t3.0 Grade Point Average on a 4.0 scale in undergraduate work\r\n*\tTranscripts from all undergraduate and graduate education attempted. ?\r\n*\tThree letters of recommendation that attest to the candidate's work performance and management potential.\r\n*\tWe require a TOEFL or IELTS for international applicants who have not had English as their primary language of instruction.\r\n*\tGMAT or GRE scores are suggested, but not required.\r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration.

RE: Admissions^Dear Greg:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to me with your questions concerning the admissions criteria for the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding the criteria for our program, we do look for classes such as statistics or calculus. If those classes are not on your transcript but you do have a strong quantitative background my suggestion would be to sit the GRE and include strong test scores in your application. Then in your personal statement if you refer to your strengths in the quantitative field without be formally educated (i.e. the proof on your transcript) then your GRE score would support that. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a note 28% of our accepted students have an Economics and Social Science academic background. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Eligibility for MSiA^Hello Sathiyaviradhan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: M.S in Analytics - Northwestern University^Dear Arnab:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us with your questions about the Master of Science in Analytics program here at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see below for answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n1.       A scanned copy of your GMAT score is all that is required for your application. \r\n\r\n2.       We receive both hard copies and scanned copies of TOEFL scores, it is up to your discretion how you send it to us. We will evaluate both.\r\n\r\n3.       Your attached scanned copy of your transcript is sufficient for the application process. After your acceptance into our program we do require the official transcript, but for now the scanned version is sufficient for our admissions committee. \r\n\r\n4.       We do require 3 recommendations. We understand this may be challenging, but in order to have a full understanding of candidates we look at what others recommend your qualities as. \r\n\r\n5.       We only control a limited number of fellowships each year. We give out a Fellowship (merit based) for 50% of tuition fees for the 4 quarters you would be taking classes. If you would like to look outside the program for scholarships or assistantships I recommend you to go to our Tuition and Fees <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/prospective-students/tuition-and-fees.html>  page and use the links for different financial aid options at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions concerning applications here at Northwestern.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MS, Analytics^Hello Alok:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to me with your questions concerning the Master of Science in Analytics program here at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question concerning out class profile, we have 32 students accepted each year. Our core classes are designed for our 32 students, and our electives are typically around that size or smaller. We do not require a GRE test score and therefore we do not provide the median breakdown of the students admitted. About 70% of our students choose to submit a GRE score to us in applications. The Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. And 73% of our students came into the program with work experience. If you would like more information and detail about our student profile I encourage you to look at our Current Students <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/index.html>  page on the website. We have provided information on academic backgrounds and industries represented by the students in our program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn regards to your inquiry about the placement of our 2012 class, once our students graduate on Dec 12th we will release all of the statistics from their class placement. We do not have that information public as of date. But please check back online in the coming weeks for an update.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are housed within the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences department and therefore we are qualified as a STEM program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions concerning our program here at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Admission Questions^Dear Fan: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo answer your questions:\r\n\r\n1.       We do not have any strict prerequisite courses, but we look for you to have taken calculus and statistics courses. We are more focused on the quantitative background when we are evaluating transcripts. In terms of computer science backgrounds, we provide a 2 week boot camp training session before our academic calendar begins. This boot camp brings in industry trainers from SQL, Cognos, SPSS, SAS, and Tableau to train our students. Some accepted students will enter the program with a background in Java and Python but it is not a requirement for applying. \r\n\r\n2.       I encourage you to supply your UNM transcript. You can list it as a separate education experience in the online application. When you do so, it will allow me to upload your transcript under the correct heading, as opposed to uploading it as other\r\n\r\n3.       Your decision to take online courses in Coursera should be included in your resume or CV. Many accepted students went that route to strengthen their application. Any certification of your knowledge will help make you stand out against other applicants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

We look for applicants to have a quantitative background, we do not expect them to have the extensive programing background you have but do look for an understanding of stats and calculus. We are hoping to bring in students with varying backgrounds to create a collaborative environment where the students can learn from different strengths within the program. If you find our information to be redundant to your existing knowledge in programing languages we allow for students to opt out of courses and take more advanced classes offered here at NU. \r\n\r\n2.       Unfortunately, we are unable to provide you with the information about our job placement after graduating from our program. Currently, our inaugural cohort is completing their final quarter here. They will be graduating in December, and we will be updating our website with their final placements at that time.  The majority of our students were offered full time positions from their internships this summer, many are in the final stages of the interview process at this time. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: Request information regarding MSIA^Hello Ajay:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us with your questions  concerning the Master of Science in Analytics program here at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question we are looking for students who want to receive a formal training in analytics (both predictive, prescriptive, and descriptive analytics). We have students from a wide variety of educational backgrounds and various industries. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for January 17th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Curious Student^Hello Darren:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe currently have only had two classes come through our program, we are a relatively new Masters Program here at NU. Our first cohort had 32 students accepted but only 30 students enrolled. Our second cohort was the full 32 students. We will only accept 32 this year as well. In terms of project work and in keeping with our goal to provide a cohort system we are unlikely to be expanding the numbers much in the future. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question, please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Do I Need to provide a TOEFL Score (Northwestern U)?^Dear Weiwei:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we will not require a TOEFL score as long as your degree will be granted by the English speaking University. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Admission query^Dear Trupti:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, we do not require a GRE score be submitted by every applicant. Only 70% of our admitted students provided their scores. Therefore, we do not release our average score since it is not an equal representation of our students.  Submit your score if you feel that it helps your application and provides us with a fair understanding of your quantitative background. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Analytics Admissions^Hello Sean:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in my response time. I am relatively new to Northwestern and we have not had an inquiry like this before. After speaking with various people within McCormick, I do not have great news. From what I have gathered, the BS-MS reciprocation applies to students who are going directly from their undergraduate degree into their graduate level courses. And when you had graduated from NU we did not offer this program. We have required all NU students to this point (recent graduates and otherwise) to fully complete our application process. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou are a great candidate for our program, I encourage you to still apply. I apologize for the inconvenience but we do not have an expedited application process for Northwestern graduates. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

RE: Information requested^Dear Premanand\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question, yes. You are an excellent candidate for MSiA. We have a wide range of students enrolled in our program. We have students coming straight from their undergraduate degree and others who have up to 10 years' experience in industry.  \r\n\r\n The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: premanand tiwari xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Master of Science in Analytics questions^Hello Manjola,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize it has taken so long for our department to respond to your request. We are very eager for you to see our campus and our program. Your request was unique, in that we do not usually allow students to sit in on classes. I know you are eager to come in this week but due to the current academic calendar it would not be the best time. Students are in midterms and they will be testing all week. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe want to offer you one of the following two options:\r\n\r\n1.       In January we have a guest speaker coming for a seminar lecture, we would love to have you come and visit, sit in on our seminar series and a class, as well as a meeting with our associate director. \r\n\r\n2.       If you want to visit in the fall, you can take a campus tour and have a 15min meeting with our Associate Director. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know which option works best for your calendar. Again I apologize for the tardiness in response from our office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

Your undergraduate degree from a US Institution will waive the English Proficiency test requirement. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: JIA XIAO xxx@xxx.xxx So do I still need to submit TOEFL when I apply for this program? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJia\r\n\r\n^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=OMA36151E^EX^JIA xxx@xxx.xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Master of Science in Analytics questions^Hello Manjola,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize it has taken so long for our department to respond to your request. We are very eager for you to see our campus and our program. Your request was unique, in that we do not usually allow students to sit in on classes. I know you are eager to come in this week but due to the current academic calendar it would not be the best time. Students are in midterms and they will be testing all week. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe want to offer you one of the following two options:\r\n\r\n1.       In January we have a guest speaker coming for a seminar lecture, we would love to have you come and visit, sit in on our seminar series and a class, as well as a meeting with our associate director. \r\n\r\n2.       If you want to visit in the fall, you can take a campus tour and have a 15min meeting with our Associate Director. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know which option works best for your calendar. Again I apologize for the tardiness in response from our office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVictoria L.

I see you have Statistics and Calculus on your transcripts. Those are some of the key classes we look at to evaluate our applicants with. We do not expect you to have experience in programing. We provide a two-week boot camp where we have industry partners from SAS, SQL, tableau, etc. come to campus for full-day instruction and informational sessions. You are not required to have a mastery of these programs prior to entering the MSiA program. We also include classes such as java as a foundation course in the first quarter. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: Can I apply for the 2014 fall term the master of Sience in Analytics?^Hi Shuhan,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur minimum GPA is a 3.0 and the average of our students is around a 3.5. I believe your numbers make you a qualified candidate and I hope to see your application. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).

RE: Interested in MS in Analytics^Dear Khurram Ali Kahn:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question about setting up an appointment to discuss our program and admission process, my first recommendation is for you to sign up for out information session for November 15th at Noon CT. I have included the link below. This session is designed to answer your questions and give you insight into our program. We will discuss everything from application process to financial options. Our Associate Director will lead the discussion and then open the last 15mins to Q&A. If you have additional questions beyond that information session we will schedule a 15min phone call.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo provide you with some common questions we have about admissions please see below:\r\n\r\n1.       We do not enroll based on rolling admissions. We wait until applications have closed and then a panel will review the applicants. Candidates typically will not hear from our committee until February. \r\n\r\n2.       Out of the 32 candidates we select the top students for our fellowship, we have limited fellowships available and they are solely given on merit based. You do not need to fill out any further material for consideration for our fellowships. \r\n\r\n3.       The GRE is not a required component of our admissions process. Because we do not require it we do not have a true average for our enrolled students scores. \r\n\r\n4.       You need only provide pdf copies of  transcripts and any supplemental material (ie TOEFL, GRE, etc). Upon admittance to the program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application).  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014.

RE: please help_North western BA^Hello Raju: \r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.] The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\nWe do not accept students for our spring quarter, the unique nature of our program requires all our candidates to begin in the fall. We then begin an 8month industry sponsored project to coincide with studies which makes it impossible for students to begin in the spring. If you are looking for an analytics program, Northwestern does, however, offer a Masters in Predictive Analytics through the School of Continuing Studies that can be done on-line while working. You can find more information on that program here: http://www.scs.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: Application^Dear Lan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.

RE: Application^Dear Lan:\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to us about the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University. The Master of Science in Analytics degree from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science is uniquely suited for either graduating seniors or individuals with industry experience who wish to prepare themselves for the demands of the 21st century job market. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBoth GRE and GMAT test scores are accepted by the program, but neither are required for admission (though sending scores from one of the two tests is strongly encouraged to strengthen the application). Since they are not required we do not give out minimums or averages.  The admission for this program is very competitive and we do receive a lot of talented applicants, so industry experience, strong test scores, recommendations (a minimum of 3), and GPA are all taken into consideration. There is no formal GMAT or GRE cutoff score, but we do require a GPA of 3.0 or higher for consideration and enrollment is limited to 32 talented students each year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is more information about the admissions profile from our last applicant pool:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProfile of the 2013 student cohort: total number of students: 32, Average age: 27, Gender mix: Male 69%, Female 31%, Nationality: US 62.5%, International 37.5%. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by academic major: 38% Engineering and Computer Science, 28% Economics and Social Sciences, 19% Mathematics and Statistics, 13% Business and Management Sciences, 3% Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground by Industry Experience (though industry experience is not required for consideration): 34% None, 28% Consulting and Professional Services, 22% Information Technology, 6% Academia, 6% Finance, 4% Engineering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted as early as September 16, 2013 for students entering in Fall 2014, and the deadline will be in February 15, 2014. We are also scheduling an online information session for November 15th at Noon CT please fill out the registration of interest <http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/admission/Registration%20of%20Interest.html>  form if you would like to get more information about this session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

RE: MS in Analytics: Prospective Applicant^Dear Sruthi:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay from our team in this response. I am very glad to hear of your interest in the Analytics program here at Northwestern.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, most candidates who apply have a quantitative background, however we do not exclusively select students with engineering or mathematics backgrounds.

"2885","Hello Abhitab; I would be happy to answer your questions",1
"2886","In terms of flexibility of the program, we have so room for students to build what they want",1
"2887","If you have redundancies with courses we offer (say Java) then we will allow you to substitute with an approved course",1
"2888","Some quarters are more flexible than others, but if you are coming for the analytics education we have built all of the necessary courses and skill classes you will need into the curriculum",1
"2889","What were your concerns with the curriculum",1
"2890","Some of our students who are looking to tailor the program to their own research interests, will take on extra projects with Diego Klabjan",1
"2891","He has a great deal of industry projects happening at one time, currently 18 of our students have taken on additional projects to help pursue their fields of interest",1
"2892","Our classrooms are far from competitive",1
"2893","Our program is structured to be collaborative",1
"2894","Our main goal is to incorporate business skills in our classroom environment",1
"2895","We give our students ample opportunities to work on group projects and practicum project",1
"2896","Since the business world is built with analytical teams, we expect our students to be able to work in that environment",1
"2897","In terms of networking, we offer a weekly social on Thursdays",1
"2898","We invite companies to come on to campus and recruit from our students",1
"2899","Our students then participate in a relaxed and informal networking session",1
"2900","We also offer lunches to network with industry contacts who come onto campus",1
"2901","In the first 3 quarters our students are spending about 20+ hours a week attending classes, 5-10hours on their practicum project, and the remaining time is for them to complete project work and any additional tasks they have taken on",1
"2902","We typically build in days for working into their schedule when they will not have any classes",1
"2903","But their last quarter (the following Fall) our students are in class for 20 hours and working on their capstone project for about 20hours",1
"2904","Students do have downtime, some try to get involved with campus activities and they will go to football games together, but it is entirely up to the students what they do as a group in their free time",1
"2905","As the above answer indicates it is difficult for the students to have lots of free time to take part in extra activities but they do most things in a big group",1
"2906","Evanston is a mixture of college students, families, and young working professionals",1
"2907","There are many students in our program who have brought their families with them and they are able to find everything they need within Evanston",1
"2908","There is plenty of housing to accommodate and it is a suburb of Chicago, and very family friendly",1

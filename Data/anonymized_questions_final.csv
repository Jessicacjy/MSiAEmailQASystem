Re: YOU Qi - Additional Application Material for MS in Analytics^Dear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\nI just called your office regarding the earlier decision on my application.

U of M can definitely provided the sealed transcripts but My previous university in China cannot send any international delivery for any students. What they can provide is to give the sealed transcript to the applicants and applicants need to delivery their transcripts by themselves. \r\n\r\nI wonder if is OK to send the sealed transcript (University in China) from me?

Inquiry into admission requirements^Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to request more information on the admissions requirements for your Analytics Program. I have a BA from New York University, and I see that your preferred undergraduate degrees are in quantitative fields, as most programs are. \r\n\r\nSince entering the working world I've gained on-the-job experience in statistical analysis and data management. I'm proficient in MySQL and familiar with Oracle-based SQL. I realized that the data projects I did in my job were by far the most fun projects I had, and that I should turn that passion into a full-time career. \r\n\r\nI'm currently taking courses online in Statistics, R and Python for fun and to prep for a Data Science program. The MSc at Northwestern looks like a great fit for me, and I'd be thrilled if I could apply as a strong candidate. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time. Looking forward to speaking to someone on your team soon!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMeredith McCarron\r\n^Merry xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^d23245412e770b636b7615b4ee9587d0^b5708dd37bb274120fc4c1dbe1b537a7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analytics Masters Query^I am interested in the McCormick Schools Masters of Science in Analytics. I have a PhD in mathematics from the University of Illinois and have since been working in the field of data analytics. Most of my work has been in data warehousing, although I have done some work in machine learning. I am interested in getting a more formal understanding of the principles and methods of data science, machine learning in particular, and have been impressed with the course of study offered by Northwestern.\r\n\r\nI would like to start my studies as soon as possible. I know the deadline for admissions this year has passed, but it appears that there are two spots open and I am sure I can meet all the admission requirements.

Will I still be eligible to apply for this course with the score of the test taken on February 11," 2012? Kindly confirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n"" 7) English Proficiency - TOEFL/IELTS (submission details below)\r\nIf you do not possess a degree from an institution where English is the primary language of instruction", then you must demonstrate your English proficiency by sitting for either the TOEFL or the IELTS.\r\nTest scores must be less than two years old at the date of matriculation (for the 2014-15 cohort, this will be September 23, 2014).

Questions about the Masters of Science in Analytics program^Hi! To whom it may concern. \r\n\r\nMy name is Curtis Huang. I'm interested in the Masters of Science in Analytics program. But I have a few concerns I wonder if anybody can answer. First of all, I wonder if I'm going to be admitted to the program? I have a bachelor degree in Physics and a Master degree in Nuclear Engineering with GPA of 3.3. And I have a year or two of java developing experience. I wonder if this is competitive? Do I need to take a GRE test to increase my chance? If I do, which part of the test should I focus on? verbal? or quatitative? Do you guys consider the assay writing section important? I'll be expecting your reply. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nCurtis Huang\r\n^Curtis xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^d82b1e611ef725df93c3a0e022a4fcc4^0cdbbe37182ef4c8978997fba48c1bd5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Re: MSiA Transcript and GMAT scores^Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI am writing because I believe there was a problem with my application to the Master of Analytics at Northwestern University. This is not the first time I have reached out to your department, but I have yet to receive a response regarding this matter. I submitted my application, paid the application fee (confirmation code 324-214466-9088) and never received a status update or an admissions decision. I believe my application was never actually reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI am terribly disappointed because I truly wanted to be a part of the program and continue to be interested.

Questions regarding the MSiA program^Hi,\r\n\r\nI learned about the MSiA program online and would very much appreciate being able to consult an admissions counsellor.\r\n\r\nBelow are the few questions I have after gathering all the information from the school's website.\r\n\r\n1. What are the historical acceptance rates for this program?\r\n\r\n2. What qualities are the admissions committee looking for in a successful candidate?\r\n\r\n3. Below is a little bit about my background which helps put some questions into context, please let me know if you see anything that could have a negative effect on my application. \r\n\r\nI graduated in 2011 from Cal Poly Pomona(highly ranked in engineering) with a 3.93 GPA in Electrical Engineering as the valedictorian of the School of Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering. After that, I was employed for 11 months in the Fuel systems division at Eaton corporation as an electronic design engineer before falling very ill, potentially losing my life which greatly changed my perspective of life. \r\n\r\nNot long after, I left my job in May 2013 and traveled the world for 6 months to gain a global perspective. Shortly after," I was involved in talks with top real estate developers in Malaysia regarding a Joint Venture or Sale of a parcel of land my family invested in. Due to this not being ""professional"" as in a corporate environment", I am concerned that the employment gap will impact my admissions.\r\n\r\n4. Would a mentor(senior engineer) qualify as a supervisory role for the letter of recommendation or does it have to be a manager level person? Would getting a letter of recommendation from the real estate development companies I negotiated with work? \r\n\r\n5. I am proficient with the c language as I work with hardware. Will this be sufficient for entering the program? Also, the program overview mentions that each student receives training and practice in  Java, Python, R, SAS, SQL, Hadoop, Pig, Hive, Mahout, Tableau, D3, SPSS, and Cognos. Now, are these languages taught in courses or is the student responsible for learning on his/her own?\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Regarding the placement for the summer internships, it is required, but is it guaranteed? Also, do students get a choice or are they designated companies? Are these companies the same every year?\r\n\r\nSorry for bombarding you with questions.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could drop me a call at (408)316-9805 <tel:%28408%29316-9805> .\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdrian Yong\r\n^Adrian xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^6a0a3169ab56b9efa3ff2fc114305b5a^c495fa2f6da8a4624897bc656bc19415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Application for MS in Analytics^Hi,\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Abhilasha Bharadwaj. I have recently moved to Chicago after completing my PhD from National University of Singapore (ranked as the top university in Asia and 24th globally in 2013/14). I have strong analytical background developed through my under grad in engineering and PhD research with hands on experience in statistical modelling etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am now looking for graduate courses in the US that are at the intersection of science and business to complement my strong engineering skills. The MS in Analytics program at North Western is very well aligned to what I am looking for.

Re: MSiA^Dear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\nMy name is Cynthia Suarez and I am writing in regards to some questions I have about the MS in Analytics program. I graduated from St. John's University with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Legal Studies (secondary major). I am interested in pursuing a career in Analytics but I wanted to know if not having a degree in Computer Science would be a hindrance when applying to the program. I also wanted to know which prerequisite classes, if any, would be recommended to take prior to submitting an application. If someone could get back to me regarding this, I would greatly appreciate it. I can best be reached through email or by phone at 516-728-5876. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nCynthia Suarez\r\n^Cynthia xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^f02bae6f3d1e3ce8e237d26591caf465^7195c6c59e233a0d8bf5ef0b6e162216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

application^Dear Officer,\r\n\r\n\r\nI just got rejected from MS in Analytics in Northwestern University. Although I know the application size must be large and there must be a lot of excellent applicants,  I was really disappointed. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis program has been my dream program since last year when Northwestern University came to UW Madison for graduate school fair. I have been striving for getting into this program ever since. I joined the honors program in statistics and \r\nlooked for research opportunities. It is true that the application process did help me know who I was, who I am and who I should be. I have spent a lot of time only to find out that I am not much into academic research compared to put my ability and passion into workplace. I really hope to start a career-oriented master program to better equip myself. MS in analytics is no doubt the perfect one.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really want to know why I got rejected and I do really hope that the committee can reconsider my application.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\nMoyu Wang xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Application-Rejection^Normal^\N^Normal^0d1b08c34858921bc7c662b228acb7ba^541fb173c8f8bcb25316e47729f8052d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jasmine Shah-Masters of Science in Analytics prospective applicant Class of 2015^Hi,\r\n\r\nMy name is Jasmine Shah and I applied for the Masters of Science in Analytics Program. I have not received an email notifiying me of whether I received admission to the program, and I believe the deadline to notify applicants was today. The website says that the admission decisions are posted on the MSIA application system, but there is no link to the application portal. Was I supposed to be notified of my decision? I also did not receive an email notifiying my application was incomplete, and I am very sure I turned in all required materials/fees.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how I can access the application portal to see my decision or notify me of my decision.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJasmine Shah\r\n^Jasmine xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Application Status^Normal^\N^Normal^6b8c47b9dbd8252c1b00de52cac2c13c^b8ce2f23bacc8158825b09e601f77d47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fall 2014: Appeal for reconsideration of application^Dear Ms.Montanari,\r\n\r\nI am an applicant for the fall 2014 MSiA program. It is surprising that my application did not get selected because it is a great fit for Northwestern University and the program, for me and here is why:\r\nMy goal is to be a CAO of a fortune 500 company. I set this goal by building on my strengths that I discovered when I was in high school. I was able to narrow down my goal to that of CAO by realizing my potential in the field of analytics, while working at Mu Sigma Business Solutions. Diversifying my experience through WNS Global Services and growing with the field, I understood exactly what I needed to guide me towards being the best CAO any industry would need. \r\nAside from the MSiA program perfectly aligning with my goal, the skill-sets I would bring to the table from experience and my insightful questions, given my understanding of the sector, will help the team reach its goal faster while simultaneously fostering healthy competition. \r\nThe foundation and structure of my learning so far will make me an invaluable member of the analytics class which would be nurtured over the next year at Northwestern University. \r\nPlease reconsider my application.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNamratha\r\n^Namratha xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Application-Rejection^Normal^\N^Normal^4b82371e3ef00af9d6d86a1db6d75e84^8e0e2bdfc0763c70ae159499f2b5cc88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Re: Northwestern University Master of Science in Analytics Program^Hi,\r\n\r\nMy name is Glenn and I recently applied to the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern. Unfortunately, I did not make the cut this time around, but I would like to continue to appeal for a position. I would appreciate if you could provide any feedback on how better I could have improved my application.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I remain extremely keen and committed to pursue a career in analytics, and want very much to be a part of the Norwestern program. Is there any way for me to appeal for a position in the course? If so, I would definitely want to do so. My goal is to become a data analytics professional, and I believe I will be able to contribute as a valuable alum to NWU.\r\n\r\nThe MS in Analytics curriculum looks robust and having spoken to current students in the year's cohort, I am confident that this is one of the finest analytics masters programs available at the moment. I would really appreciate an opportunity to be a part of this great community.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nGlenn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 10 January 2014 06:45, Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n\tThanks!\r\n\r\n\tGlenn\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tOn 7 January 2014 12:44, MS in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx To complete your application, you must also submit the following items:\r\n\r\n\t*\t$50 application fee\r\n\t*\tOfficial Transcripts\r\n\t*\tGRE/GMAT general test report and (if required) TOEFL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThese materials should be sent to:\r\n\t\r\n\tMaster of Science in Analytics\r\n\tNorthwestern University\r\n\t\r\n\t2145 Sheridan Road\r\n\tEvanston, IL 60208 \r\n\r\n\tPlease contact our office if you have questions at 847-491-7205 <tel:847-491-7205>  or xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Application-Rejection^Normal^\N^Normal^bb1a54d52276bf2347365af231572348^f021f743b767cbde9e23c713e3688573,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expected math skill level upon entering analytics program^Hi,\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat level of mathematics should prospective students have in order to enter the program?\r\n\r\n\r\nI currently have an excellent understanding of statistics and econometrics, using multpile regression, multicolinearity, etc... with a basic understanding of calculus.  My understanding of basic computer science is pretty low, but your program shows it has a 2 week intensive boot camp to help students get a necessary computer software comprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould I be taking computer science courses and multivariate calculus in preparation for your applying to your program?\r\n\r\nThanks for addressing my concerns.  \r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n--\r\nMr. Greg Merrell\r\nShenzhen Foreign Languages School - AP Center\r\n1 Yantian Road, Yantian\r\nShenzhen, Guangdong Province, China xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx  \r\n~~\r\nGreg Merrell??\r\n?????? - AP??\r\n1????, ??,\r\n???,???, ?? xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n^Greg xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^cf7f38340f8b1e4ee0c305a3647f45f3^d4221dbc412e39da96bf603eb2840cae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About Dream.^Dear Sir or Madam,  \r\n\r\nI am Jiaqi Xie, an applicant of the MSiA program. I am sure that the admission committee is very busy and working hard to review applications. I deeply respect that and thank you all for your time and effort. \r\n\r\nNo words that can express my eager to be part of this program. So even though I have a lot to say, I will just save it. \r\n\r\nIf it is possible, I wish to update my resume(attached below), which I believe better demonstrate my experiences and can help the committee's evaluation. Also, I ordered a copy of official GRE score report from ETS to the program, I was wondering whether it has been received?\r\n\r\nNorthwestern has always served as a dream of mine. So please let me know if there is anything I can provide to help the admission committee to better evaluate me.\r\nThank you. I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJiaqi\r\n\r\n--\r\nFrank Jiaqi Xie\r\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | Class of 2014\r\nB.S.

Re: Application fee receipt^Dear Victoria,\r\n\r\nThanks for your confirmation. This is really helpful !!\r\n\r\nI actually had one additional query. I have already submitted the three recommendations, as suggested in the online application portal.Last week, I had a conversation with a senior leader of my team who also agreed to provide me a recommendation. \r\n\r\nSince I have submitted the application, the online application portal is closed for editing now. Is there any way by which I could submit one additional recommendation?

Query about the recommendation letter^Hi,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am Amit Singh Parihar and am applying for the MS in Analytics Fall 2014 batch. I have completed all the requirements for the application but I am missing a recommendation letter. I am having trouble getting in touch with one of my teachers whose recommendation has not been submitted yet. I have sent multiple e-mail notifications to him. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs it possible to submit my application before the recommendation comes in, and then the recommendation letter can follow later? I understand that my application will not be reviewed until all application materials are received, but can I submit the application with the missing recommendation letter in order to meet the deadline?\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease respond as soon as possible.

Re: Northwestern Analytics: Application Deadline Reminder ^Hi,\r\nI am very interested in the program and have excellent academic and professional credentials. After a long time in IT Consulting, I am considering specializing in Analytics and your program is ideal. \r\nSince it has been a long time since I graduated, it would be very difficult for me to get in touch with my professors.

Re: Shengyuan Huang's transcript^Dear Ms. Richmond,\r\n\r\nHow are you? This is Shengyuan from Wake Forest University. I tried to contact my two professors but it's hard to get in touch with them during weekends.

I wonder if there is any chance that they can still submit the recommendations for me on Monday the latest?

Re: Supplementary Materials for Admission to MSiA Program - Transcripts^Hi Victoria,\r\n\r\nOne quick clarification regarding the MSiA application.

Application^Dear Victoria:\r\nHow are you doing?\r\nGreetings from Lan Ma, Beijing China.\r\nToday is your application deadline. Could you please receive my application files through your application system and also through your email. I have a strong wish to enter Northwestern University. I have good courses preparation and some working experience as an assistant business analyst, which I think will lead me well to my career in analytics.  My weak point is that I did not perform well in my TOEFL test.  I really hope that you could accept me.  On the one hand, I can perform enough TOEFL score in my next test, and on the other hand, I can take some English courses if necessary after I enter the program.  Please believe my ability to accomplish my study goal. As far as I know that quite a few US universities give potential good students conditional admission.  I hope you can do me this favor, too. I would be moved to tears.\r\nLast night, I myself made a short video clip about my personal introduction, and wish you could know more about me.  It is just for your reference.\r\nI lay all my hope on Northwestern University, which is the only school I will go to without any hesitation as long as you could accept me.\r\nI have a crush on the Great Lakes.  When I was in my primary school, I stayed in Toronto for some time, and saw the Great Lakes which left me a deep memory.  Even now I could still see the beautiful lakes, the Niagara Fall, etc. Therefore, I would like to return to the Great Lakes.\r\nI will dream Evanston, Chicago, Lake Michigan, the old Sears Tower, China Town, Chicago Bulls, Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, Chicago River...etc. before March 17, when you will release the admission result.\r\nI am looking forward to hearing from you and seeing you at Evanston.\r\nMay God bless me.\r\nI am very grateful to all your kind help.\r\nBest regards,\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nLan\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n <http://res.mail.qq.com/zh_CN/htmledition/images/icon_att.gif> ?QQ?????????\r\n <http://mail.qq.com/cgi-bin/ftnExs_download?k=7e38393726b294cbc7fc36594030031853090a52070102561d5d5d05541d0501510014565502571a015b5a5550020001050f5d0766293150425d5c430f5e5644105e4b580b107d565e187456485d41033005&t=exs_ftn_download&code=0897f017> \r\ngreetings from Lan Ma.mp4 <http://mail.qq.com/cgi-bin/ftnExs_download?k=7e38393726b294cbc7fc36594030031853090a52070102561d5d5d05541d0501510014565502571a015b5a5550020001050f5d0766293150425d5c430f5e5644105e4b580b107d565e187456485d41033005&t=exs_ftn_download&code=0897f017>  (53.66M, 2014?03?16? 19:20 ??)\r\n?????? <http://mail.qq.com/cgi-bin/ftnExs_download?k=7e38393726b294cbc7fc36594030031853090a52070102561d5d5d05541d0501510014565502571a015b5a5550020001050f5d0766293150425d5c430f5e5644105e4b580b107d565e187456485d41033005&t=exs_ftn_download&code=0897f017> ?http://mail.qq.com/cgi-bin/ftnExs_download?k=7e38393726b294cbc7fc36594030031853090a52070102561d5d5d05541d0501510014565502571a015b5a5550020001050f5d0766293150425d5c430f5e5644105e4b580b107d565e187456485d41033005&t=exs_ftn_download&code=0897f017\r\n^Prospective xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^674092ee79055fa766eb3e1e5cdb3238^1375b598c31353ceea025ecd2f666b79,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSiA Program Questions^I'm very interested in applying to the MSiA program and I have a few questions as I progress with the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Is there an option to take additional management classes as part of this degree program, or to adopt more of a management focus through the practicum and internship?\r\n- Do all references have to be academic? I received my BA in 2007 and have continued to develop my analytic skills through my work experience. As a result, I believe my managers would be qualified to comment on my qualifications for the program and would also shed more light on my application in general.\r\n- While the GRE scores are not required, if I do submit them does it have to be sent officially from the GREs, or will an unofficial score qualify?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJoanna\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJoanna xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^adb19ba35e8543e58a3a5cbd35cebf69^10809604de27c1ae59bcff4c64fd953d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questions about my application^Hi,\r\n\r\nI have two questions about my application that I'm about to submit:\r\n\r\n1) When I took the GMAT I had the scores sent to Northwestern afterwards. Does this mean that the analytics program has them in my file and I don't need to do anything else? Some of the wording in the application made it seem like we might also need to send the score report in an email instead.\r\n\r\n2) I currently have one letter of recommendation that has yet to be submitted. I haven't been able to get in touch with the recommender for over a week now, so I'm wondering what the best way to proceed with this is. I last spoke to the recommender a few weeks ago and he knows the deadline is the 15th. And while I think it's pretty likely he just hasn't gotten around to sending it until the last minute, if I still can't get ahold of him and he does in fact miss the deadline I'm wondering what the consequences are. If this is really a hard and fast deadline I could probably scramble and find someone else to put a recommendation together for me at the last minute, but I don't want to have to ask someone to do that unless it is absolutely necessary. Basically I'm just wondering if there is a bit of leeway in terms of a single recommendation possibly coming in a few days late or if I should plan on asking someone else to put one together for me tomorrow. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n-Mike \r\n^Michael xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^dbd03fe93182179a05c08738ca009833^131dc3c3987637b03b7e0ac778fc7c4e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Application Inquiry^Dear Admissions Officer,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMy name is Zhang Chi and I am applying to Master of Science in Analytics. I have submitted my application along with all required documents except for official Toefl score which is supposed to be sent directly from ETS. Currently I have a Toefl score of 98 and its now being rescored, thus this score is frozen and cannot be sent to you. I think after rescoring there is a large chance that the score will be over 100, and I am wondering if its ok that I send it to you as soon as its activated, approximately by the end of this month. And could you please add this information to my application file? Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nZhang Chi\r\n\r\n xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^ca4b37fba6bf37d1dbed7802c9b412ef^f5a98643165ffdceea77f91ca876604f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One question regarding the current status, from a MS in analystics Applicant^Dear Professor. Klabjan & Professor.

I have a question regarding the student status and hope that you could provide me with a solution to it,\r\n\r\nI am currently in the process of I-485 application and expect to receive the permits for work and travel in a month. (I-485 stands for Application to Register Permannet Residence or Adjust Status). It is also expected that I would receive the Permanent Resident Card in three to four months. So in this case," I might not need the I-20 and immigration documents for the admission. I am wondering whether I should still select ""F1 student"" in the application system or is there any other choices for me to elucidate my current status?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nYe\r\n^Ye xxx@xxx.xxx Montanari^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e;/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dkl524;/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lnm8916d3^EX;EX;EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^ac9df338face14f385c7495d30257aa3^6c3b8f87320876493f03d135be108a76",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Re: Transcripts - Masters of Science in Analytics^Dear Victoria,\r\n\r\nThanks for the confirmation.\r\n\r\nI will really appreciate if you can answer following queries.\r\n\r\n1. Is option of education loan available for this course. Most of the colleges don't provide the loan for this course, hence just wanted to confirm again.\r\n2. One of my recommender is travelling and might not be able to fill the recommendation by 15th Feb. Is it ok if the recommender fills the recommendation later?\r\n3. Since the course is new, I wanted to have a look at the employment report for this course. If you have one, please share it with me.\r\n4. I completed my UG from one of the most reputed institute of India, Indian Institute of Technology, and have over 6.5 years of work experience. I guess (as it is on the scale of 10) my GPA will not be 3 on a scale of 4.

RE: Unofficial Transcript^?I called ETS and the individual I spoke with said that my unofficial raw scores, which I sent your way, are only available immediately after I take my exam. Raw scores must go through a score verification process, and once this is complete, my scores will be posted on the website and deemed official. This has not happened yet, and that is why nothing is showing up in my account. I believe there is nothing I can do other than wait for ETS to process my scores and send out a score report. I apologize for the inconvenience. \r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nPooja Aphale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPooja Aphale\r\nUniversity of North Carolina, Class of 2014\r\nGillings School of Global Public Health\r\nEnvironmental Health Science; Business xxx@xxx.xxx <tel:919-478-1981>  | 919-478-1981\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Aphale, Pooja xxx@xxx.xxx Hope this helps! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPooja Aphale \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPooja Aphale\r\nUniversity of North Carolina, Class of 2014\r\nGillings School of Global Public Health\r\nEnvironmental Health Science; Business xxx@xxx.xxx <tel:919-478-1981>  | 919-478-1981\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Aphale, Pooja xxx@xxx.xxx Do you think it will reach in time for the February 15th deadline? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you need!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPooja Aphale\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPooja Aphale\r\nUniversity of North Carolina, Class of 2014\r\nGillings School of Global Public Health\r\nEnvironmental Health Science; Business xxx@xxx.xxx <tel:919-478-1981>  | 919-478-1981\r\n\r\n^Aphale, xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^dc4d5668e69986420a8f668795e67528^4d0c03c325d4f1e10fa21a62d4fc1321,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Campus Visit Resources^To Northwestern Analytics' Admissions Office, \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing because I'm an applicant to the MSA program, and I'm looking for any resources or advice you might be able to give me in advance of a visit to Northwestern's campus next week. I will be in Chicago this upcoming Friday-Sunday for a Loyola University debate tournament, and as I'm in the final stages of submitting an application, I thought this would be an ideal chance to capitalize on a trip I'll already be making in order to visit Northwestern's campus during the day on Thursday, February 13. \r\n\r\nMost of the resources I found were focused on undergraduate campus visits, and the sample classes in the undergraduate Industrial Engineering/Management Science section all seem to occur on M/W/F only.\r\n\r\nThat being said - and recognizing that not all of these will be feasible - information or advice on any of the following fronts would be greatly appreciated: \r\n--Where on campus is the MSA program and the bulk of its classes situated? \r\n--Would it be possible to sit in on one of the 2014 cohort classes, to get a sense of how classes are conducted? \r\n--Would it be possible to pass my contact information onto a current student? I'd love to talk to buy coffee/lunch for a someone currently enrolled and get their perspective on the program. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and best wishes,\r\nCody Wild  \r\n^Cody Marie xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^6bb07be8563276811be162b8a3488a85^96f7bbee5f98931c3560acb7303eea1c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Ellen Zaitchyk transcript - Lviv Polytechnic Institute^Dear Victoria,\r\n\r\nI ordered a report with the code 3144 only yesterday," after I got your email explaining that selecting ""Northwestern University"" would not work", so I'm afraid you won't receive the official report in time. Thank you for including an unofficial score report in my record in the meantime.\r\n\r\nI also have another question. If one of my letters of recommendation is delayed, would my file be considered late, even if all other materials are on time? The reason for this is that my manager, who is writing this letter is in the middle of transitioning from his job, so he has been understandably very busy lately. I can include another letter just to make sure that 3 are received on time, and the 4th one will arrive later - would this be a better scenario?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEllen\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Ellen xxx@xxx.xxx I'm attaching a screen shot of my scores - would this work instead of PDF? \r\n \r\nThank you,\r\n \r\nEllen\r\n \r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\nTo: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Ellen xxx@xxx.xxx would you be able to retrieve my official report that way? \r\n \r\nThanks again,\r\n \r\nEllen Zaitchyk\r\n \r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\nTo: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Ellen xxx@xxx.xxx \r\nThank you,\r\n \r\nEllen xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\ncell: 414-745-7763\r\n\r\n xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^39b9faab931dce6c8a9d67a0ecc40f0d^cedca8f3ea5882970c3b5780381e9f87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some questions about the MSiA program.^Dear Mr./Ms. Admissions Representative,  \r\n\r\nMy name is Yuxi Wu, an undergraduate student in the Ohio State University. I'm really interested in MSiA Program in Northwestern University. However, I have a few questions when I apply it online. \r\n\r\nOn the website, it said that official transcripts need to be mailed directly from the University. However, I transferred from China to the Ohio State University. The university in China does not provide mailing service. The university does provide sealed transcripts. Could I mail the official sealed transcript myself instead of from the university? \r\n\r\nThe Ohio State University does provide the mailing service. Therefore, the transcript in the Ohio State University could be mailed directly from university. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nYuxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n^Wu, xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^dde25412da2ca628ceba06bcad30f559^5fdf4dbed6bdc52f027f9db5a51965ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Queries - MSiA^Dear Sir/ Ma'am,\r\nI am Anupam, I have completed my under-graduation from one of the most renowned college of India, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi in 2006. I came to know about Masters in Analytics course recently and am really excited to apply in the college. I have few queries regarding the course, and would be grateful if you may answer those.\r\n1. I have over 6.5 years of work experience in various analytics firm. The academic requirement asked on your website is 3.0 at a scale of 4.0. In IIT, my CGPA was 6.0 at scale of 10. Is there any standard way to convert the scale of 10.0 to 4.0? Since it was over 7 years back, I was wondering that can my CGPA still act as a deterrent to my application? Can you please suggest that with this CGPA should I apply or not?\r\n\r\n2. Financial Aid - Being an international student, will I be eligible for loan from US banks? If yes, would I be required to provide any collateral for the same? \r\n\r\n3. TOEFL - My engineering course was taught in English, can I get waiver for TOEFL as mentioned on the website?\r\n\r\n4. OPT  Will I be eligible for OPT after the course?\r\n\r\n5. Placement  Can you please shed some light on the placement/ career opportunities for international students after MSiA i.e. median salary, % placement etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nAnupam Joshi\r\n^anupam xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Purple Category;Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^a46a6e12c7e06dfd4f7b93eb7e92afd0^86f6a643ab3a0c381ae47e42999c4886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Likewise," if I send a copy of my GRE scores to ""Northwestern U MS Analytics (3672)"" through the GRE website", do I also need to scan a copy and submit it through email?\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\nAdam Smith\r\n^Adam xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^8623fb3ac0ca10de5f5e6572c3ce4950^bd3f2430ff61b363636f82848b68186d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: M.S. in Analytics Application^Hello Victoria  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing up on my question from a few months ago, during which timeframe are you planning to hold interviews with finalist candidates?  Based on your earlier email, Im assuming mid-February through mid-March?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI ask because Im attempting to juggle a few different applications processes.  Im in a difficult position right now because I have been accepted at similar programs offered at NC State and Texas, but have to submit my decisions to each in early February to avoid losing my spot.  Im just trying to gauge the competitive standing of my application and the timing of your process.  Id hate to have to make a decision before having a sense of where I stand, but I also wouldnt feel good about reneging on a commitment I made to another program should I get accepted to Northwestern. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI know this an irregular question, but I certainly dont want to miss out on the kind of opportunity the Analytics program at Northwestern presents.   Thanks for understanding. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCollin Thomas\r\n\r\nRegulatory Analyst\r\n\r\nRegulation - Revenue Requirement\r\n\r\n(503) xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^34450e56ad32848881d89c2dcefea7f2^1799fa4f021ba44199dcce286dde4b82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questions about the admission process^Dear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\nI am writing to ask several questions about the admission process to make sure that I have everything there before the deadline. (really don't want to miss this opportunity!)\r\nAs for standardized test scores, I don't have the paper score reports of GRE/TOEFL because of postal service problem. Can I send you the screenshot of the score report on ETS website instead? If no, I would send my scores to your program codes. That way, do I need to notify you or you will automatically fetch the scores?\r\nIn addition to above questions, I also want to know the specific number of students that can receive the fellowship. If it's confidential, just ignore this question:) But fellowship will help me a lot if I am lucky to get enrolled. \r\nThank you for reading this. Please let me know your answers. Thanks again!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTianle\r\n \r\n^Chen xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^7943b68a5100092a443ce2178190d966^7a71a57e9c6d70965261d7d5d5bf616d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regarding transcripts mailing method^To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nI'm Mengchun Wu, an engineer in Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Tokyo, Japan. I'm applying for Master of Science in Analytics program in Northwestern University. During application," I find a request under ""Education Information""", that transcripts should be mailed directly from the University to the MAP office. However, I don't think my undergraduate university has such service. It only gives official transcripts without mailing service. \r\n\r\nCan I mail it by myself? Also, my undergraduate university doesn't offer sealed transcripts any more. It uses security paper instead. Is that OK?\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to your reply.

Re: About GRE & TOEFL^Hi Victoria:\r\n\r\nThank you for your replying.\r\n\r\nThere is another question about my delay on the TOEFL scores, I asked in my last letter, too:\r\n\r\n\r\nI will take the TOEFL exam in March 1, the earliest time I can choose when I registered. And I will send this score as soon as I get it. Is this acceptable if other conditions I submitted meet the standard of the program? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI know it's a little cross the line, but it's really important for me to enroll early. Maybe it's no use, but I am really confident that I will get an high score in that exam. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIs it possible? Please let me know. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nNingji Wei\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2014/1/24 Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tFollow us on Twitter xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tFrom: tidues xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThank you very xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^33ceaeed266d42427101f630c25780d2^e7610ff31ff8210437f1b0dc93d7b8ff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regarding Admission in 2015^Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am currently working as a Business Analyst at an Analytics startup in Bangalore, India since August 2013. During my work, I came to learn about MS Analytics course in your esteemed institution and I am quite eager to attend the 2015 Course. \r\n\r\nI completed my BSc Mathematics Honours with Statistics (3 Years)as my ancillary from Banasthali University, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India with 58% in 2011 and then did MSc in Actuarial Economics(2 Years) from Madras School of Economics, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India with 68.5%. My subjects in Post Graduation included Statistics, Applied Econometrics, Stochastic Models, Finance and Financial Reporting. I have been quite interested in Applied Econometrics and hence chose to work in an Analytics Firm. \r\nI am currently working with softwares such as SAS and R and working in a startup always has its advantages like I am directly working in Client Projects and there is ample scope to learn. \r\n\r\nHowever, I came across your requirement of a GPA of 3.0 in Undergraduation Degree. Please let me know if I am eligible to apply for the 2015 Session with my Background. \r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and would be waiting for your Reply.\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards,\r\nTrina R.

Data Analytics and Natural Sciences^Dear Lindsay Montanari,"\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I attended the information session for the Master of Science in Analytics program.  I currently work at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources as a Management and Data Analyst.  Recently our agency has gotten more and more involved in the ""Big Data"" movement and I'm seeing a big need for good data analysis skills in the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if Northwestern ever partnered with public agencies that work in this area such as NOAA", EPA, or state climate and natural resource agencies. I'm very interested in data science and data analytics, but specifically in their application in the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nMy background is actually in both IT and the Natural Sciences.  My undergraduate degree is in Biology and Environmental Science, however I also took several computer science courses and I'm currently working on a Java Development and SQL Certificate at a local college. In my current job I manage the development of a web application and database system to track the outcomes of conservation projects across the state. I lead a team of programmers and conservation scientists to develop this system.\r\n\r\nI'm very interested in this program as I feel it will really help me develop and expand the analytical skills I need.  I'm just wondering if it would be possible to connect some of the work I'd do in the program to natural resource data problems.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter Holt\r\n\r\nPS - I'm looking to apply to the Fall 2015 Cohort.\r\n\r\n\r\n^Peter xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^07b92be1e4a1994df1732122197f41d5^c73bf743ba79e805d6b4cdd668b03670,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is this acceptable if other conditions I submitted meet the standard of the program? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI know it's a little cross the line, but it's really important for me to enroll early, maybe it's no use, but I am really confident that I will get an high score in that exam. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIs it possible?

MSiA 2014^Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a keen interest in applying to MSiA fall 2014 program at Northwestern. I have started preparing for my application. However, I have few doubts regarding the application. It would really be helpful if you could throw some light on the following concerns:\r\n\r\n1) The applicant has been asked to submit 3 academic letters of recommendation.\r\n\r\nI have a work experience of around 4 years in Business Analytics industry. Since, I have been out of school for a long time now, would it not be good for me to submit a mix of academic and professional recommendations? Let's say 1 academic and 2 professional recommendations. I would definitely like to move ahead with the preferences of Northwestern University.\r\n\r\n2) The tuition cost is $ 15,038 per quarter. As the program duration is 15 months, what will be the total tuition cost? Will it be $ 15,038 x 3 OR $ 15,038 x 4 ? Apart from that, do I stand a good chance to earn a scholarship? I am convinced that my application will stand out.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAnurag Gupta\r\n\r\n\r\n^Anurag xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^b1597594a4b83543b38271073a4a4270^d7f65afcb47920c076a204b6930c5a96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from an interested applicant^My name is Jeffrey Wan and I'm a prospective student who's interested in Northwestern's Masters in Data Sciences program. I'm have some questions regarding the program and I was hoping you could help make a decision as to which program to apply to.\r\n\r\nAllow me to give you some background information about my career: I currently work at an options market-making and high-frequency firm, I also work part-time at a policy advocacy organization for Asian American families and children, I previously have worked as a senior trader at an equity trading firm, professional poker player, and tennis coach, and I graduated from Amherst College in 2008. Throughout my career in trading and poker, I have seen just how powerful analyzing data can be: it can save people time, resources, and eliminate theories that are widely at variance with data. I would like the opportunity to invest in myself by going back to school. \r\n\r\nHere are some facts about myself and some questions I had about the requirements:\r\n1) I took a college-level calculus course in high school and did well on the AP. Does this count still? I also recently relearned calculus at my last job as a derivatives trader. I also relearned some calculus on Khan Academy and Coursera.\r\n2) I took a Coursera course in comp sci and I have programmed some applications in c#. Do I still need to take a college-level comp sci course? Is this a prereq?\r\n3) I haven't taken linear algebra. Does this course typically have prerequisites? I don't have any coursework in matricies or vectors or spaces. Is this a problem? If so, is this something that I can take after being admitted to the program? Are there typically prereqs for linear algebra?\r\n4) My GMAT score is a 690. Is this within range?\r\n\r\nWhat should I do to prepare for the upcoming applications? What do you think I need to become a viable candidate?\r\n\r\nI've attached a resume to this email, just to give a clearer idea of my candidacy.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJeffrey xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n(212) 363-0854 \r\n^Jeffrey xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^7223464a3b64b728d954f46398c32e09^64e256fe8cc646509353ad6e4e887983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Question about Recommendation^Dear Analytics Program Admission Officer, \r\n\r\nMy name is Chun Li and I am a graduate from IEMS at Northwestern in 2010.  \r\n\r\nI am really interested in this Master of Science in Analytics program, and I am applying to the 2014-2015 cohort. \r\n\r\nI am writing to inquire about your requirement in recommendation. Three supervisors of mine at work have been working on my recommendations, and I just realized today that you recommend 1 academic recommendation since I've been work for a little over 3 years. May I ask if it is ok to have three recommendations from professional setting? They all work with me very closely in same consulting projects so should be able to provide very detailed information about my work performance and management potential. I am just worried it would not be very polite to ask one of them stop writing when he/she already started. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nChun\r\n^Chun xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^8fe686c93585ba5e12b88768c223d087^be84bcfd31ae389065254404516a3ca6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I graduated from the university with a finance degree. Am I still eligible to apply to this program? Will the non-information management academic background decrease my chance to be applied?\r\n\r\n2.      What a competitive GMAT score will be? I recently took the test and got 700(Q51). Will this core be too low to strengthen my profile?\r\n\r\n3.      Now I am working in the field of corporate finance. However, to be frankly speaking, I feel an urgent need to improve my skill to deal with all kinds of Big Data issues since my job contains a big proportion of data analysis.

Analytics vs Predictive Analytics^Hello.  I'm currently enrolled in the online Predictive Analytics masters program through SCS.  I am looking to change careers after completing a B.S. in Chemistry at Pitt and working for several years in video production.\r\n\r\nThe McCormick program looks interesting to me.  However, it does not begin till Fall 2014, and I wanted to take some courses earlier this year. (This is why I'm currently enrolled in MSPA).\r\n\r\nI wanted to know how different these programs are, especially in professional outcome of students.  Also, how rigorous is the McCormick program?  Coming from a hard science background, I would like some heavy math and computer coding in the program.\r\n\r\nFinally, would you recommend completing GRE's before applying?\r\n\r\nAn option I'm considering is to gain more experience in this discipline earlier in the year through the online MSPA and then start a brick and mortar program in the fall and complete a more traditional degree.\r\n\r\nAny guidance is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nSean Dolinar\r\n^Sean Dolinar^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SDH4623FC^EX^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^e07f19eaedbec10eec6d934deadf157d^5f868ec33152f4fc23250a21b20c60da,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Master of Science in Analytics Prospective applicant query^Dear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\nThis is in regards to the Master of Science in Analytics program in North Western University. I am Ankit Samaria, currently working in Filix Consulting Pvt Ltd in New Delhi, India. I have got an honours bachelors Degree from Maharshi Dayanand University Rohtak and did my schooling from Delhi Public School Faridabad. \r\n\r\nI am a Business analyst in Filix Consulting where my work ranges from Requirement gathering to system configuration and support Our company works in Oracle E Business Suite ERP implementation and I am an important part of my organization.\r\n\r\nDuring my tenure with Filix I found out the importance of data in any organization. While gathering and analysing data i realized that there are too many problems that the people face. They are not able to present us the data properly and sometimes it happens that we are not able to visualize it properly because of which there are cases that system is configured wrongly.\r\n\r\nI realise that data analytics may be lagging and would like to work on it. I also realise that data analytics is still in a very early phase in India and if I am able to nurture and enhance my skills in it then in future it will be very beneficial to India. I want to take full advantage of the current scenario in India where data analytics is just getting important and in 2020 we will require at least 1 Lakh experienced analysts in India and  have plans of setting up a good business firm in India where data analytics play a vital role.\r\n\r\nI am interested in doing this course. I have gone through the website and read the prerequisites of admission and have various queries. Please help me resolve the queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) What is the selection criteria? \r\n\r\nI have done the bachelors degree in computer science and have good knowledge in computer languages like C,C++, PHP, SQL\r\n\r\nI have 2 years experience in Oracle Ebusiness suite ERP implementation where we provide solutions to various problems faced by any organization through System \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Do I need to give any Paper like GRE, GMAT, Toufl etc. I am an Indian candidate and hence these papers are given importance as they help to get a good course abroad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that I will get answer to my queries so that I can analyse what need to be done for admission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and Regards\r\n\r\nAnkit Samaria\r\n\r\n^Ankit xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^ca2240814e5368c293630881dac1bcbd^5d4ee53405a69042990c332c6902336b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About GRE & TOEFL^Dear Officer:\r\n\r\nI've already submitted my application. And there are some questions:\r\n\r\nFirst:\r\n\r\nCan I send my GRE scores via ETS system?

Is this acceptable if other conditions I submitted meet the standard of the program? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI know it's a little cross the line, but it's really important for me to enroll early, maybe it's no use, but I am really confident that I will get an high score in that exam. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIs it possible?

According to the application instructions, I should provide 3 academic references considering my recency of graduation, but will 1 academic & 2 professional recommendations from my managers suffice ?\r\n2.\tAs an international applicant," the instructions on site state that I need to provide TOEFL scores only if my medium of instruction was not English in my under-graduation. However I can provide a scanned copy of an official letter from my college which states that the medium of instruction has been English. So can I use this instead of sending official TOEFL scores ?\r\n3.\t""Official copies of GRE/GMAT scores (not required but you may submit) and", if necessary, TOEFL scores.

questions for apply ^\thi,\r\n\r\n\tfirst I want say that I love your school and the program on  Analytics.\r\n\r\n\t I am a girl who held the green card but studying at Beijing in China.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tAnd actually I hold the two degrees when I graduate. Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,and also Queen Mary,London.SO, CAN I HAVE A WAIVER ON TOEFL?\r\n\r\n\tBUT now I found that I couldn't  offer you a transcript of London university since the joint program ( BEIJING&LONDON dual degree) only gave students one transcriptChinese university transcript.So I have no transcript from the London university, but all courses and all grades are as same as the Chinese university, they are the joint program.They use the same transcripts indeed.I will submit a official student certificate to identify my dual degree.\r\n\r\n\tIt is so important for me because there is no enough time for me to take TOEFL test.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tI am studying in beijing university of posts and telecommunications?and Queen Mary at the same time?during the four years study?I was teached by professor in QM?and will gain the degree in Engineering of BUPT and degree in management of QM.Our school and QM is the cooperation in running joint program,means I am also two school students, studing in Beijing but teached by the QM. The teacher will teach us almost all of the courses.Our exams is also tested in English, then package the papers to London and gain the feedback of educational administration system from England.\r\n\r\n\tMy college is China's first certification in both Chinese and English dual degree college. It is very strict.\r\n\r\n\tI mean that I will offer you some certification about my education to identify I was teached by QM formal semesters, and also identify that I was taught as same as people who spend 4 years in London.  I am the student from BUPT?international school?and also the person who is a permanent resident, maybe you can search the university program I am in?and many projects in usa are admit it.\r\n\r\n\tthanks a xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^0d1b08c34858921bc7c662b228acb7ba^3b225a4fc07e74e7af19c783bc567bfa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letter of recommendation for Peiheng Hu^Hi!  I received a letter of recommendation request on 12/16 from the MS in\r\nAnalytics for applicant Peiheng Hu, and when I went to the web site it\r\nsaid I had uploaded the letter already.  I don't think I gave you a letter\r\nfor him between getting the request on 12/16 and today (12/19), so in case\r\nthere's a mistake, please accept the attached letter.  Peiheng is really a\r\nspecial student, and I think he'd be a great fit in a more\r\ntechnically-oriented Analytics program like yours.  (I think he'd be very\r\nsuccessful in other programs too, but I think he'd get more out of your\r\nprogram.)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJoel\r\n\r\n---\r\nJoel Sokol\r\nFouts Family Associate Professor\r\nH.

questions for apply ^\thi,\r\n\r\n\tfirst I want say that I love your school and the program on Analytics.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tI am a girl who held the green card but studying at Beijing in China. \r\n\r\n\tAnd actually I hold the two degrees when I graduate. Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,and also Queen Mary,London.SO, CAN I HAVE A WAIVER ON TOEFL?\r\n\r\n\tBUT now I found that I couldn't  offer you a transcript of London university since the joint program ( BEIJING&LONDON dual degree) only gave students one transcriptChinese university transcript.So I have no transcript from the London university, but all courses and all grades are as same as the Chinese university, they are the joint program.They use the same transcripts indeed.I will submit a official student certificate to identify my dual degree.\r\n\r\n\tIt is so important for me because there is no enough time for me to take TOEFL test.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tI am studying in beijing university of posts and telecommunications?and Queen Mary at the same time?during the four years study?I was teached by professor in QM?and will gain the degree in Engineering of BUPT and degree in management of QM.Our school and QM is the cooperation in running joint program,means I am also two school students, studing in Beijing but teached by the QM. The teacher will teach us almost all of the courses.Our exams is also tested in English, then package the papers to London and gain the feedback of educational administration system from England.\r\n\r\n\tMy college is China's first certification in both Chinese and English dual degree college. It is very strict.\r\n\r\n\tI mean that I will offer you some certification about my education to identify I was teached by QM formal semesters, and also identify that I was taught as same as people who spend 4 years in London.  I am the student from BUPT?international school?and also the person who is a permanent resident, maybe you can search the university program I am in?and many projects in usa are admit it.\r\n\r\n\tthanks a xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^0d1b08c34858921bc7c662b228acb7ba^3b225a4fc07e74e7af19c783bc567bfa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking a class in the MSiA department^Hello,\r\n\r\nI am a graduate student currently getting a PhD in theoretical chemistry at Northwestern and I saw a class in your program that looks very interesting (MSiA - 421 Data Mining). It seems that there is one spot left in the class and I want to know if it would be possible to take it in the following quarter. I have extensive knowledge of programming and mathematics through my research and analytics is something that I am considering for a future career. If this is at all possible, please let me know. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time, \r\nHenry Heitzer\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nHenry M.

Questions about MS Analytics Application^Dear MS Analytics Admission Team,\r\n \r\nI am really interested in your MS Analytics program and have started my online application. I noticed that the instruction for recommendation says three academic references. I graduated from my master program in May and I am currently working, so should I provide two academic references and one work reference instead?\r\n \r\nIn addition, I want to clear if I have fulfilled the prerequisites of the program. I hold a bachelor and a master degree in Accounting, but I did take courses in calculus, algebra, statistics, and Visual Basic and got 51 on the quantitative section of GMAT. So do you think my quantitative background is enough to apply the program? Anything else I need to improve?\r\n \r\nThank you!\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nAnqi Fang\r\n \r\nSent from Windows Mail\r\n \r\n^Anqi xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^eb6193b661e92d5fbe3f790ebdb7df6e^a5d4629cee82b96a4a15c2dac264c8e6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Master of Sc. in Analytics^Hi\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing regarding the Master of Sc. In Analytics offered by McCormick School of Engineering.  I have the following questions:\r\n\r\n1) For how long has Northwestern University been offering Master of Sc. In Analytics?\r\n\r\n2) How big is the class for that program?\r\n\r\n3) How is this program compared to Master of Sc. in Predictive Analytics by Northwester University, School of Continuing Study?  Are the courses have different concentration?  Does the two schools share the same faculty?\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached is my resume.  Though I haven't had official training/Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, I have had more than 11 years of experience in software development and IT industry.  Will that be suffice to offset the disadvantage of not having a bachelor degree in Computer Science?  \r\n\r\nI also noticed from the website that GRE score isn't required but recommended.  I am planning to take it anyway in March 2014.  Will it be too late to be submitted for consideration?  Other than GRE score, what are the other elements you weigh heavily when you evaluate applicants?  \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any merit-based scholarship offered to students taking this program?  If I would like to apply for merit-based scholarship, what other requirements I should fulfill to maximize my chnaces?\r\n\r\n\r\nI appreciate your assistance and guidance.  And I look forward to hearing back from you.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nYoong Shin\r\n^Yoong Shin xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^1a5fcf74732abdf44557ccb4b0ce8ee3^8b3e37480ca8bba1ee598fea483f2bb1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ross Gelber^I uploaded my letter of recommendation for Ross Gelber, who has applied to the Master of Science in Analytics program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI also want to add to that letter this comment:  Ross Gelber has majored in the undergraduate program in Statistics and Management Science at UNC/Chapel Hill.  This university does not have an Engineering program  (that program is available at NC State/Raleigh).  I think that his training in STOR (and Economics) will have prepared him for your Masters program.  His objective aligns well with your program, and I think that he will succeed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHarvey Wagner\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n^Wagner, Harvey xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Blue Category^Normal^\N^Normal^8dc866ce8e506c85dfc34245ea1855e4^70e5ce9be6b2ae6cacbf080f2ccb96a9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MS Analytics Application Queries^Hello,\r\n\r\nI am in the process of completing my application for the MS in Analytics. During my undergraduate, I completed an exchange year at The University of Edinburgh; I am wondering if you would like me to note this as an institution attended, even though I did not receive a degree from them. Also, I have completed two non-credit certificates, one at Stanford University and another at Cornell University(online). As I did not receive a transcript from them, would you also like me to mention them on my application (I did receive a certificate of completion from both).\r\n\r\nLastly, I am in the position to submit my application this week. I am planning to take the GMAT in January/February; I am wondering if it is an option to submit my application, and then submit my GMAT scores if the admission's committee requires them (or if a high score is obtained).\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nFrancesco Aggani\r\nThe University of British Columbia | Okanagan Campus\r\nBSc.

After having gone through all the requirements, I would like to apply for Fall 2014. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would want to clear two things before making the application. \r\n\r\n\r\n1) I am an international student from India and currently studying Master's in Computer Science at the Concordia\r\n\r\n University, Montreal which is an English Speaking University.

MSiA Program Inquiry^Dear MSiA Program Office,\r\n\r\nI am a student who recently graduated with a combined degree in Applied Mathematics and Biological Science from University of Calgary, Canada. Im very excited when I heard about your Master of Science in Analytics program because I believe Business Analyst will become very essential in the business realm within the next few years, and Northwestern University is the best university that offers such program. However, I do understand that your program selection is very competitive and applicants need to have a very strong background. I have a 3.7 GPA and my GRE score is Q170, V150, AW4. In addition, I have spent spent two years in a Biological lab working on project that required data analysis, and I was once hired by my university Mathematics Department as an undergrad TA because of my excellent performances in Math courses. Is it possible for you to let me know what are my chances to get into your Fall 2014 MSiA program?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and Im looking forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nLin Li^Lin xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^40c6d3601c29f574746d1021e592c4c2^6b58b317b2131c915de58a4774fe51a9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Re: Scanned official transcripts for Applicant: Wenxi Lei/Confirmation Code: 324-191971-3338^Hello Ms. Richmond,\r\nI have a question regarding GRE scores. I have taken GRE General Test and I am willing to submit those scores. I have report unofficial scores in the application system. However, according to the program website, I need to send an scanned copy of the score report by email. It usually takes several weeks for students to get paper reports from ETS by regular mail. Hence, I am wondering if I can send official scores to the department or School of Engineering directly. Since the process is all electronic, it will take much less time to report GRE scores to your progam. Thank you for your replies.

Query on MS in Analytics program^Hi,\r\n\r\nI am extremely interested in applying for admission in MS-Analytics program at McCormick School of Engineering, Northwestern University. I am currently working with Accenture as Sr. Consultant and I have total of 6.5 years of work experience in Analytics. \r\n\r\nCan you please help me with few queries - \r\n\r\n1. TOEFL - Do I need a TOEFL score to apply for this program? (I have completed by undergraduate degree from IIT Guwahati,India where medium of education was English. I also have GMAT score of 730)\r\n\r\n2. Scholarship/Financial Aid - On the website it is mentioned that a scholarship is offered to 7 students each year. Is there any eligibility criteria for the scholarship? Does everyone who applies is considered for the scholarship or one need to apply separately for the scholarship.\r\n\r\n3. Are the admissions offered on a rolling basis or all the applications are evaluated simultaneously only after the last date of receiving applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSaurabh\r\n^Saurabh xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^4813814f64c2f9a54c193cfaf83d10fa^6e9631777f6775e89a2db7321bababf2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Re: Information about MSiA program at McCormick,Northwestern.^Dear Victoria\r\n\r\nThanks for the information. My reason to connect with current student is to learn about the program that is beyond numbers, or information on the website. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you can comment on my queries. \r\n\r\n1 How flexible is  the curriculum? Is every one able to tailor their program as per their interest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.Regarding classroom environment - would you describe it as very competitive," where there is a certain amount of pressure on students to make contributions? Or is it more ""congenial"," or mutually supportive, where one feel at ease contributing to discussions or projects?\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Can you comment on  networking within class and with companies during the program? \r\n\r\n\r\n4. What's a typical week like for students? How many hours are spent in lectures,  projects, and experimental learning?\r\n\r\n5. How much time does one have for e/c activities? Is there a culture of being part of different clubs and  organizations within the department , and other Northwestern programs?\r\n\r\n6. How is the housing and life for families at  Evanston ?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nAbhitab Jain \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Nov 21, 2013 at 2:11 AM, Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^93b3c775f646aca7ef1bc375b17ce265^f5b98360e4ef18d1d20f1782f41a110f
Do I need a TOEFL score?^Dear Madam / Sir, \r\n\r\nSorry to disturb you. I'm interested in applying the M.S Analytics Program in your department.\r\n\r\nI noticed that either the TOEFL or IELTS score is required of all international applicants for whom English is not the primary language.\r\n\r\nI'm a graduate student at CU Boulder and obtained my master's degree in physics.

However, if I choose to send a score (since i have taken the GMAT exam) do I need to send an official score from GMAC or uploading a scanned copy of the official score report is sufficient?\r\n\r\n2) Do I need to send the official score of TOEFL through ETS or uploading a scanned copy of the official score report is sufficient?\r\n\r\n3) The website says that during application phase uploading scanned copies of the transcript will suffice the purpose, however prior to admission the transcripts need to be sent over mail to your admission department. Please confirm. If uploading scanned copy is fine during application, could you please look into the attached file and confirm if this will suffice?\r\n\r\n4) I have a 6+ years experience in Analytics field in India after I completed my post graduation in 2007. In such a case, your website says to get all the 3 recommendations from professional field. Is it an absolute must because getting 3 recommendations while you are at work may be challenging at times?\r\n\r\n5) What % of the tuition fees can be obtained by fellowship/ scholarship/ assistantships ?\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nArnab Chatterjee\r\n^Arnab xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^869f74ea2b4d45e0bfe76719de2beba1^d5f4d4af00ce005280c1df11c75c433a

Re: about MSiA admission-TOEFL requirement^Dear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your explanation about the TOEFL requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have one more question about the transcript of institutions I have attended. On your website," I saw ""*Official transcripts in sealed envelopes", or by secure electronic delivery direct from the institution," will be required before matriculation."" \r\n\r\nDoes it mean during the application I just need to submit the copy of my official transcript through email? And if I will be admitted", then I will need to mail the official transcript in sealed envelopes to your department address?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf so, since one of my educational institution does not send transcript for students, I can only order transcripts, pick them up, and then send them by myself. But the transcripts will be in sealed envelopes and have official stamp. Is that acceptable?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2013/11/6 Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx Thank you for your inquiry about the program, we are looking forward to having you as a potential applicant for Fall 2014!\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tFrom: JIA XIAO xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx So do I still need to submit TOEFL when I apply for this program? \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThank you,\r\n\r\n\tJia\r\n\r\n\r\n^JIA xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^879e2fcfca79799f6e2052ad288dbb7d^82c4e72b17a7635fc2b0ca8d912d9c7d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Needed few clarification regarding Letter Of Recommendation and work experience^Hi,\r\n\r\nI was really interested to pursue masters at North western. The courses offered perfectly aligns with my interests. But I needed few clarifications regarding letter of recommendations and work experience. \r\n\r\nI'm working in Intel for the past 2.5 years. And I have been involved in multiple Analytics projects. Hence, if my Letter of recommendations are from a professional source, it would be more relevant. But I see in the site, it is mentioned that academic sources would be preferred. \r\n\r\nIs it recommended to have Letter of recommendation from 2 professional sources and 1 academic source for 2.5 years experienced candidate ? And will there be any weightage for work experience ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSuman Bharadwaj S\r\n^suman xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^bd1fc38cc2f6f3577f304cc92ca7cca7^adebf0d73e46514cd0f8d81b404fe8bf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Query: Prospective student on Financial Aid for MS Analytics program^Hi,\r\n \r\nI am a prospective student currently in the process of getting my application ready for applying to the MS in Analytics program at NorthWestern. I had a query on the financial aid options available to International students. The website speaks of fellowships covering 50% of the program fees. \r\n \r\nTo give you a background context : I am an international (Indian) student with 5+ years of experience in IT with an MBA in Marketing and a Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science) degree keen on taking this course at your esteemed university.\r\nRequest some clarity on the questions below:\r\n\r\n1.\tAre the fellowships applicable to International students  and if yes then what is the criteria? Do I stand a chance?\r\n2.\tApart from fellowships, are assistantship options open to International students?\r\n3.\tIs there a separate procedure to apply for a fellowship ? (As per my understanding the application on submission will be implicitly be considered for fellowship)\r\n4.\tBy when do we know whether or not the fellowship has been granted?\r\n\r\n \r\nLooking forward to hearing back from you.\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n \r\nWarm Regards,\r\nAditi Upreti\r\n \r\n \r\n^aditi xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^0787fb00906474fefbec7d01a40741aa^a91aece9c59e851cd3a34651118cc0fd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hadi Khawaja - Interest in MSiA Program^Lindsay & Victoria,\r\n\r\nThank you for hosting the Information Session earlier today on the MSiA program at NorthWestern University. I've been following this course for some time now and am very interested in what it has to offer both academically and professionally. I've graduated with a B.B.A. in Banking & Finance from the University of Georgia and was starting my Masters in M.I.S. before Analytics captivated me. I'm an international student candidate since my nationality is Pakistani, but I have lived in the US for the last 12 years. Interesting case indeed.\r\n\r\nI would like to visit the campus and also ask you questions related to the program and admissions if possible. What would be a good time or date for me to visit?\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing more about this exclusive program.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHadi Khawaja\r\n(404) 953 - 2366\r\n^Hadi xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^d0fb109bd24d7aa9f250f3c7fc71682c^605606ffcf2a56cdbe359f4368379e35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in MSiA^Hello,\r\n\r\n  I have recently been researching analytics masters program, and have become very interested in the one offered at Northwestern. I have a BS in Zoology and currently work at the Lincoln Park Zoo conducting ape research. In my current position I have mainly focused on large scale data analysis, and am familiar with Tableau, SPSS and other software that are focused on in this program. I also are in charge of the administrative aspects of my center, and am familiar with Cognos as well. So, for all of those reasons and many others, I am very interested and hopeful about pursuing this further as well as learning more about the field of analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I probably will not be applying until 2016, but I wanted to start working on trying to make sure my application is as strong as it can be. My GPA from my undergrad is unfortunately not as high as I would like it to be. I was curious is the 3.0 GPA or higher was a strict cut off or would some other factors (i.e. good GRE score) actually be taken into account to outweigh that.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Also I looked at the MS in Predictive Analytics through the continuing studies school, and I was unsure of what, if any, major differences there were between the two programs, aside from the part-time or full-time. Thank you so much for you time and any further information you can provide with me would be extremely helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarisa Shender\r\n\r\n\r\n^Marisa Shender^marisashender@xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx Category^Normal^\N^Normal^53e44628d27324f950444b626b5ea217^9f791ff4de328a641efef3dc86f2e9b7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

question about application^Hi, \r\n\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding applying to master program in analytics. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy husband is interested in applying to this program, and he is currently working as a chemical engineer  in Hanwha Chemical, one of the leading chemical company in Korea.  He graduated chemical engineering from Seoul National University.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of applying to master program in department of analytics, is it required to have taken classes of linear algebra or advanced mathematics other than calculus? He has taken calculus and mathematics for engineers but not other than that. He is open to take summer course before the class starts, if he can get admission, but we are not sure if the courses are crucial to get admission or not. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be very helpful for us to know if having engineering background makes us suitable for this program or not. We think it is and he really wants to study this field, but we hope to know your opinion before we begin application process. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help in advance. \r\n\r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nStephanie \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStephanie Kwon\r\nSnurr  & Stair Research Group\r\nDept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering\r\nNorthwestern University\r\nEvanston, IL 60208, USA\r\nTel) 847-467-3252 \r\n^Stephanie Young Sun Kwon^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SYK638^EX^Master of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^9db78e5de5546d287f46010a7980a761^718dffa8aff8f4788f350063f0a749ef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Admission Questions^Dear graduate admission officer,\r\n\r\nI'm really interested in applying for the Master of Science in Analytics program. The curriculum and indusrial exposures all look very exciting. I have a few questions regarding the admission process:\r\n\r\n1. What are the prerequisite courses of this program? Or what level of mathematics, quantitative and computer science skills are expected to be considered in the admission? (I'm an economics undergraduate)\r\n\r\n2. I had a one year study aboard experience in University of New Mexico from Aug 2012 to May 2013. Should I list this Institution as a separate education experience in the online application? If not, should I still send the official transcript of UNM as part of my undergraduate transcript? (Majority of credits and courseworks were transferred to my Chinese transcript, but the grading might be inaccurate.)\r\n\r\n3. I didn't have much programming experiences, so I'm taking online courses in Coursera on subjects like machine learning and data analysis computing. Will these online courses strengthen my application profile?\r\n\r\nI'm looking foward to hearing back from you.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n-- \r\n\r\nFan Xiao\r\nSouthwestern University of Finance and Economics\r\nChengdu, China\r\nCell:+86-187-8020-6357\r\nEmail: xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^7e4c49eeaf64abc79426b217e3f6e0f3^9740c36f2251b46f912dd6f45aef82ef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE: Prospective Applicant^Victoria, thanks for your information about this program. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMay I get to know how many students you are going to accept for Fall 2014? And what is about the admission rate based on the previous years? I got the Master degree in Natural Science(Food Science), but working experience on consumer insight data analysis. This program could be perfect and necessary for me to further develop my professional skills, and allows me to chase my dream to be an analyst.  I am not confident on my natural science background, since I found most of students there have degree in CS, EE or statistics. It would be helpful for my application if you can give me the answer for these questions.

Question From Prospective student ^To who may concern, \r\n\r\nHi, this is Juntao Yao, a Chinese student. You can call me Stella actually. I am writing to you to express my great interest in your school's MS in Business Analytics program. Now I am a full-time master student at DePaul University in Chicago and my major is Human Resource Management. \r\n\r\nI found my interests in data analysis after taking courses of Statistics and Managerial Economics. I want to have a deeper study in quantitative areas after graduation from DePaul. After researching for some while, I found your Master of Science in Analytics program is pretty excellent and I am trying to apply for 2014 Fall. I have several questions about your program:\r\n\r\n1. my current MSHR program is full time two year one and I am going to graduate in June next year, so can I waive the TOFEL score? \r\n2. I wonder do you have specific courses as prerequisites for this program? \r\n\r\nI really appreciate it if you can answer me questions above. Thanks for your time. I await your reply! \r\n\r\nHave a nice day!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStella \r\n^JUNTAO xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^8cedf9720405d5bbb12866249d1a6f53^b97c7072fce5472cd456d1db26f24344,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.S. in Analytics Application^Hello  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI recently submitted my application for the M.S. in Analytics program at Northwestern University and now see that my application fee and transcript have been successfully received.  I just wanted to reach out to the admissions department to get a sense of the timing of the process from here.

If so, can you provide any estimate  on the time that will be needed for review? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your response and for considering my application. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCollin Thomas\r\n\r\nRegulatory Analyst\r\n\r\nRegulation - Revenue Requirement\r\n\r\n(503) xxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxxxxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^34450e56ad32848881d89c2dcefea7f2^1799fa4f021ba44199dcce286dde4b82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GPA Question^Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding a possible GPA cut-off for applicants. I know you look at the application holistically, but my GPA was below 3.0.

RE: Inquiry to Studying at Northwestern University^Dear Victoria,\r\nI am happy to hear from you.\r\nI am grateful you consider my background adequate for pursuing this Master.\r\nI am planning to go there next fall (2014) and I want to know the possibilities I have to get this fellowship you mentioned and at the same time to get the research assistantship.\r\n\r\nI have recently taken the TOEFL iBT and I got an 89. I can retake the TOEFL test but at the moment I do not have any available date to take it. Regarding the GRE test, I will take it the 28th of October. However, a previous examination from Fulbright indicates that I will be doing it with a score higher than 160 in the quantitative section. Additionally, my GPA in my 5 year undergraduate degree is 3.7.\r\n\r\nI am worried about scholarships because I am really interested in Northwestern University. The program description is one of the best I have found and I am sure that there I would gain the professional skills needed to become an impressive data Analyst. The scholarship that I have already earned in my home country will enable me to pursue a 2-year master's degree by paying for my maintenance, health insurance, transportation, but only limited portion of my tuition and fees. Without any fellowship that allows me to cover the total or partial amount of the tuition I will not be able to study at Mc Cormick. Therefore, I need extra help if I do not want to miss such opportunity to my future career.\r\n\r\nPlease, do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nNahuel Grasso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Mensaje original-----\r\nDe: Master of Science in Analytics xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^88c1063ff32a6bee284c077cc1fc362d^8f9443c379bc78ca309a14c94e5cfd91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questions about the analytics course^Hello!\r\nI'm Jongwook Kim who is interested in the analytics MS course in Northwestern McCormic.\r\nI send the mail to ask some questions about the course.\r\n\r\nI studied business at the college, so I wonder how deep knowledge of programming and mathematics is required for the program especially for students whose background is non-computer science.\r\nWhen I saw the curriculum of the program, there were lots of courses about computing, such as Java and algorithms, and I felt like little vague to figure out how deep professional knowledge about computing is required before and during the course.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I wonder whether I need some programing and mathematics skills before taking the course and what can be good to study and prepare for me to go to Northwestern university for MS in Analytics in terms of programming and mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm really eager to study analytics at Northwestern and waiting for your answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, and have a nice day:)\r\n^Jongwook xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^09a1eab91651ba970520bc909cdc5897^55c93aef265f66932c98caedfa1e11bd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Question regarding application references^Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm a prospective student for the class of 2014 and had a question regarding the type of references you are looking for in the application.\r\n\r\nThe application states that you want 3 academic resources. I have been out of college for over 3 years, and was wondering if you would accept professional references instead.

MS in Analytics: Prospective Applicant^Hi\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am Sruthi and I work in the Competitive Intelligence/Strategy Development team for Deloitte US in Hyderabad, India. I am interested in pursuing a career in analytics. I came upon the MS in Analytics program offered by NorthWestern and would like to know more about the prerequisite requirements for the course. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have completed by Bachelors in Business Administration. I later did an MBA, and I have been working for two years with Deloitte. I have been talking to professors at other colleges that offer a similar program  and they asked me to complete the following three Math subjects of four credits each  * Calculus, Advanced calculus, and Linear Algebra. I am currently pursuing these subjects through the Indira Gandhi Open National University in India. I plan to give the Calculus and Linear Algebra exams this December, and the Advanced Calculus paper in June 2014.  However, I did not see any such pre-requisites in Math subjects on your website, and had a few questions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*         Would the fact that I have not done my undergraduate studies in engineering or Math affect my application prospects? \r\n\r\n*         Does Northwestern require any Math pre-requisites? \r\n\r\n*         If yes, I would like to know if it  will accept the above timelines to complete the prerequisites, considering I would not have my Math results in hand when I apply. However, I would be able to furnish a bonafide certificate of proof that I am pursuing these courses. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSruthi\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSruthi Thomas\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCompetitive Intelligence\r\n\r\nDeloitte Support Services India Pvt Ltd\r\n\r\nTel/Direct: +1 615 718 8196 \r\n\r\nwww.deloitte.com <http://www.deloitte.com>  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n^Thomas, Sruthi Susan (US - xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^0884d92c1913c34c71ed64584548e73a^b2964b1f0496f2fcbd06ed5e1e06dff3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.S. Analytics Program Application^Hello - \r\n\r\n\r\nI recently began the process of completing an application for the M.S. in Analytics program, but have run into some problems with my account.  It seems that the information I entered originally was erased (which is not a problem for me, I can re-enter it) but I wanted to make sure that the letters of recommendations which were submitted made it through the system.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any way someone can check on the status of the letters?  My recommendors received and responded to the automated email that was originally generated, but I just want to be absolutely sure before I ask them to re-submit.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCollin Thomas\r\n\r\n^Collin xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Red Category^Normal^\N^Normal^dce952622fefaef1d15512436fad75a4^dfd91c7fab68a532300496c290f640d5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since there is no available test placement in nearby, I am very worried about this. Which score do you recommend me to send? Or I can submit both of them?

Inquiries of Admission-MS in Analytics-Jianhao Long^Dear Northwestern University Admissions Board,\r\n\r\nMy name is Jianhao Long, or Steven, from China. I'm very interested in the Master of Science in Analytics of Northwestern University and planning to apply for the 2014 fall entry. I have read through the website and got a few questions about the application process. And I hope that you could answer them. I appreciate any help from you.\r\n\r\n1. In regards to international students, I understand that the program requires candidates to prove their language proficiency by submitting the TOFEL or IELTS score. Can this requirement be waived? In my case, I graduated from Hong Kong Baptist University, in which English is the only language of instruction, with a degree of Bachelor of Business Administration (Honours), AACSB credited. In addition, I have a three-month working experience as a lifeguard in Maryland, USA. Plus, I had a IELTS score of 7.0 in 2009 while I was a sophomore, now expired. I am confident that I can survive in the English environment. So if this proof of proficiency requirement could be waived for me, I will have more time to focus on the other parts of the application. (I have already taken the GMAT and sent the report to the program)\r\n\r\nHere is the description regarding to TOFEL/IELTS from the website:\r\nIf you do not possess a degree from an institution where English is the primary language of instruction, then you must demonstrate your English proficiency by sitting for either the TOEFL or the IELTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were exempted from this requirement, do I just leave the TOFEL test score on the system blank? Considering I am an international applicant, do I need make other notes on the application system about the exemption?\r\n\r\n2. During the application to other programs, I realise that, upon application or admission, some programs of other universities may specifically require the candidates from China to have their transcripts and/or degree certificate verified by a third party and to send the verification report to the admissions office. Does the MS in Analytics program have similar requirement? As all my transcripts and the degree certificate are issued by Hong Kong Baptist University, they will be originally written in English and Chinese. Doing such verification will incur unnecessary expense. I just want to know in advance whether NWU has the similar requirement so that I can better prepare and will not miss the deadline of application. \r\n\r\n3. Does the McCormick School of Engineering, other departments, or office offer assistantship to international student?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for answering my questions, and I look forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteven Jianhao Long\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n^Jianhao xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^7c1f49d61ed6898c39e681358d8e6ab2^6eaeada44669fa57311bdba51856b223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My other consulting assignments include solving problems in specific areas such as improving Order success rates, ticket volume reduction, customer experience enhancement, Campaign Management, Product Design and Bundling among other things, all of them in Telecommunications Domain.\r\n\r\n I would like to add to my current skills the data analytic advantage essentially because my career goals lie in the direction of analytical consulting or business analytics leadership. Though my consulting skills are strong by virtue of my job, my data analytic skills are limited. Considering the kind of intense interest that data analytics invoked in me, I decided to go for masters in analytics that can help me achieve my goals. \r\n\r\nAfter some research I zeroed in on your program. Essentially because it seemed a logical continuation of my career so far to achieve my goals.\r\n\r\nConsidering I will have 6 years of BPM and IT experience (9 years of total experience) this September(please find my profile attached), I would like to know how your program can be apt for me. I was unable to gauge from your website what is the average work experience of your class. I would like to know how effective your course will be for people with my kind of experience. \r\n\r\nAlso please let me know the current class average work experience.\r\n\r\nP.S: My GMAT score is 660. And I am a Mechanical Engineering Graduate(first class).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnil\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n============================================================================================================================Disclaimer:  This message and the information contained herein is proprietary and confidential and subject to the Tech Mahindra policy statement, you may review the policy at http://www.techmahindra.com/Disclaimer.html externally and http://tim.techmahindra.com/tim/disclaimer.html internally within Tech Mahindra.============================================================================================================================\r\n^Anil Kumar xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^74c5ae1ded79f3b468fe2f2d6e9cd6c9^2f9ef4bb4410eb0c44ae11a71aaf65a8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inquiries of Admission-MS in Analytics-Jianhao Long ^Dear Northwestern University Admissions Board,\r\n\r\nMy name is Jianhao Long, or Steven, from China. I'm very interested in the Master of Science in Analytics of Northwestern University and planning to apply for the 2014 fall entry. I have read through the website and got a few questions about the application process. And I hope that you could answer them. I appreciate any help from you.\r\n\r\n1. In regards to international students, I understand that the program requires candidates to prove their language proficiency by submitting the TOFEL or IELTS score. Can this requirement be waived? In my case, I graduated from Hong Kong Baptist University, in which English is the only language of instruction, with a degree of Bachelor of Business Administration (Honours), AACSB credited. In addition, I have a three-month working experience as a lifeguard in Maryland, USA. Plus, I had a IELTS score of 7.0 in 2009 while I was a sophomore, now expired. I am confident that I can survive in the English environment. So if this proof of proficiency requirement could be waived for me, I will have more time to focus on the other parts of the application. (I have already taken the GMAT and sent the report to the program)\r\n\r\nHere is the description regarding to TOFEL/IELTS from the website:\r\nIf you do not possess a degree from an institution where English is the primary language of instruction, then you must demonstrate your English proficiency by sitting for either the TOEFL or the IELTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were exempted from this requirement, do I just leave the TOFEL test score on the system blank? Considering I am an international applicant, do I need make other notes on the application system about the exemption?\r\n\r\n2. During the application to other programs, I realise that, upon application or admission, some programs of other universities may specifically require the candidates from China to have their transcripts and/or degree certificate verified by a third party and to send the verification report to the admissions office. Does the MS in Analytics program have similar requirement? As all my transcripts and the degree certificate are issued by Hong Kong Baptist University, they will be originally written in English and Chinese. Doing such verification will incur unnecessary expense. I just want to know in advance whether NWU has the similar requirement so that I can better prepare and will not miss the deadline of application. \r\n\r\n3. Does the McCormick School of Engineering, other departments, or office offer assistantship to international student?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for answering my questions, and I look forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteven Jianhao Long\r\n\r\n^Jianhao xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Yellow Category^Normal^\N^Normal^7c1f49d61ed6898c39e681358d8e6ab2^8cfca3147da7db1dfcc18859c328f9a3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(I have already taken the GMAT and sent the report to the program)\r\n\r\nHere is the description regarding to TOFEL/IELTS from the website:\r\nIf you do not possess a degree from an institution where English is the primary language of instruction, then you must demonstrate your English proficiency by sitting for either the TOEFL or the IELTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were exempted from this requirement, do I just leave the TOFEL test score on the system blank? Considering I am an international applicant, do I need make other notes on the application system about the exemption?\r\n\r\n2. During the application to other programs, I realise that, upon application or admission, some programs of other universities may specifically require the candidates from China to have their transcripts and/or degree certificate verified by a third party and to send the verification report to the admissions office. Does the MS in Analytics program have similar requirement? As all my transcripts and the degree certificate are issued by Hong Kong Baptist University, they will be originally written in English and Chinese. Doing such verification will incur unnecessary expense. I just want to know in advance whether NWU has the similar requirement so that I can better prepare and will not miss the deadline of application. \r\n\r\n3. Does the McCormick School of Engineering, other departments, or office offer assistantship to international student?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for answering my questions, and I look forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteven Jianhao Long\r\n\r\n^Jianhao xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^7c1f49d61ed6898c39e681358d8e6ab2^c653e9b39f29c9cd67f40426ac1e52d8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My current major is Accounting, but I have special interests in mathematics and statistics area. Before entering the graduate school, I have the intention to take an additional year in my current undergraduate school, to take more credits about math and stats courses I'm interested in. Will a five year graduation affect my application process in any means?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n^Ivy xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^77d9acccc9a75097837d8e398caa8577^fed610ce44b4d342d3cdb277d1c628b6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Master of Science in Analytics questions^Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Manjola and I am interested in the Master of Science in Analytics Program at McCormick School starting in September 2014.

Re: MS in Analytics^Dear Sir/Ma'am,\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to apply to Northwestern University's prestigious Master of Science in Analytics programme but I have a few doubts regarding the requirements which I want to clarify.\r\n\r\nI have completed my undergraduate education from one of India's most premier college - St. Stephen's College, Delhi University, with a first division degree. My degree however was a three year Bachelor's program with an honors in Mathematics and I am unsure as to whether I am eligible to apply to the program as most colleges in the US have a four year Bachelor's degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso my course did not award a GPA, rather it gave me an absolute percentage, so I am not quite sure as to how to go about converting it into a GPA out of 4. It would be really helpful if you could guide me towards the conversion process.\r\n\r\nI have also been working in the Analytics domain for projects for some of the largest retailers in the world, for the last two and a half years, and have used SAS and SQL extensively on big data-sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards,\r\nAditi Gupta\r\n\r\nAnalyst, \r\nAccenture Management Consulting\r\nGurgaon, Haryana\r\nIndia\r\n^Aditi xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^5644a7decc1cc197d81bc0c333a287be^0e15e344c73228fcfc643bfc5c5ae7fb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Query regarding admission requirement^Hi\r\n\r\nI have a query regarding the minimum requirements mentioned for application of MS in analytics. It states that minimum of 3.0 GPA is required in Undergraduate studies. I want to know how rigid is the University policy for this? My GPA is 5.6 /10 around 2.2/4 but my major was Mechanical Engineering. I have 2 years of work experience in relevant field. Do I stand a chance if I apply or will the application be out rightly rejected? \r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nThanks & Regards\r\nAvinash Mahesh Joshi\r\nSenior Business Analyst\r\nMu - Sigma Business Solutions\r\nBangalore\r\nPh No - +919980169018\r\n^Avinash xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^1a9e1f02ff8c160ea64b1d32da249261^b686c02c00a3e3abc5a9fb48860ae1a9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questions about admission to your MS in Analytics program^Dear Sir or Madam,\r\n\r\nI am currently pursuing Computer Engineering at BITS Pilani(graduating in Summer 2014). My search for master's degree programs in data science has led me to take a closer look at your Masters of Science in Analytics program(Fall 2014 entry). I would love for you to answer the seven questions I have listed below:\r\n\r\n1. What GRE scores do I need to get into your program?\r\n2. What do you do with multiple GRE scores?\r\n3. Will you be using all parts of my GRE score, i.e even the verbal reasoning and the AWA parts?\r\n4. Will GRE scores be used for anything other than admissions such as scholarships?\r\n5. How competitive is admission to your program?\r\n6. What was the average GRE score for last year's incoming batch?\r\n7. I am planning to give the GRE Mathematics Test. Will a good score increase my chances of admission to your program? If so, what is a good score?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAmlan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nAmlan Limaye\r\nStudent | BITS Pilani Dubai\r\n+97150 1771260 | xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n^Amlan xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^3f1eda944525102615bf2a1dab0771e5^cc65f09ffbcf97c97c5ea66d73c800b3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancelling Enrollment in the Analytics Program^Dear Northwestern Analytics,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am sincerely grateful for the offer of enrollment in the Northwestern Analytics program and the additional scholarship offer.  I wanted enter the program so that I could get a position applying analytics for social good.  I have been offered the opportunity to work in analytics for TMC, a division of C.H. Robinson.  The role is directly in line with my goals because I would be using analytics to improve the efficiency of transportation networks which will reduce the cost of goods to the end user and greenhouse gas emissions by reducing fuel usage.  After agonizing over the decision for over a month I have decided to accept the job offer and not pursue an in class masters degree at this time.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have a great deal of respect for Northwestern University and I hope to enroll in the online predictive analytics program in the near future.  I recognize that this must be a substantial inconvenience and I humbly apologize, but I will not be attending this September.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWarmest regards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nErik Osland\r\n\r\n\r\n*************************************************************************************************************************\r\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.

Fwd: 2015-2016 Inquiry - MSiA^Greetings!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Katyayani Rajput and I am interested in pursuing the Master of Science in Analytics (Class of 2016) at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. I have perused the website for admission information and have the following queries -\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Is the MSiA degree a STEM qualified program?\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Prerequisites  - Are there any specific statistical  or programming language prerequisites to apply to the program? \r\n\r\n\r\n2) LOR - From the FAQ list on website, I gather that if a person has left undergraduate university more than 5 years ago, then all 3 LOR's can be from professional workplace. However, in my case, I have finished my under graduation 7 years ago and graduation 4 years ago.

Query regarding MS - Analytics^Hello,\r\n\r\nI am Nischith Manjunath from Bangalore, India. A Software Engineer by profession with about 4 years of multi-disciplinary work experience and an MS degree with a 8.1/10 CGPA (roughly translates to 3.3/4.0).\r\n\r\nI am interested to apply for the MS-Analytics degree next academic year. I see from your website that the very first requirement is 3.0 Grade Point Average on a 4.0 scale in undergraduate work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interest of saving precious time for both parties, I would like to know if my candidature will be considered on the basis of my professional experience and graduate scores because my undergraduate GPA is less than 3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your earnest response.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nBest Regards, \r\n\r\nNischith. \r\n^Nischith xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^f6546b9f3eab2cf49307c28dacc7efa5^2238180faa4e1f2d29df3660bf65df80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interests in Analytics. Campus Visit in Aug?^Dear Addmisson office,\r\n     I am Yuwen, a senior business school undergrad from China. I am considering applying for 2015Fall MSiA and would like to arrange for a campus visit. I will be in US from Aug 11 to Aug 25. Do I have any chance to talk to a program representative? I would really appreciate that!!:)\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am now interning with a specialized data firm, most of the time working on credit risk modeling and data warehousing. I love every minute working with data XD. I am a little bit of data geek. I always feel like putting somthing in my SAS data set. I have talked to a lot of specialists from our clients in Analytics or BI positions and decided to work as a business analyst.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have studied the curriculum of several analytics programs, among which I like your program best, since it can give me a whole picture of the field. I have a little concern about my background, i.e. I'm a business student with limited knowledge in programming and database comparing to CS students. If possible, I hope to learn more about the program, especially the technical requirements, to decide if I can handle the courses.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n     A highlight of my personal info.:\r\n     First Name: Yuwen\r\n     Last Name: Wang\r\n     E-mail: xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx  xxx@xxx.xxx xxx@xxx.xxx \r\n     Program interested: MS in Analytics\r\n     Applying for: 2015Fall\r\n     Preferred visiting time: Aug 11 to Aug 25;\r\n\r\n\r\n     Looking forward to your reply soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nYuwen\r\n^Yuwen xxx@xxx.xxx of Science in Analytics^/O=NUEXCH/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Oma36151e^EX^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^\N^Normal^\N^Normal^0562b9084967ca655738549ca7323eed^ee212c125a1cfa9bd66449c0ab456b6d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
